It is not for nothing that we speak of a democratic deficit in the European Union that has to be filled .
Soldiers and internally displaced people , refugees , have had no restriction , no incentive , no guidance , no punishment , no governance whatsoever on how to behave in this regard .
It is crucially important and it is my duty and my responsibility , as President of the European Commission - which has to represent the general European interest - to call on the responsibility of all leaders in Europe to make the best efforts to achieve that compromise .
The west and the north-west of my province are crying out for infrastructural developments that will provide links within the province and encourage industry to those areas .
All other solutions would be a betrayal of the voters in the six Member States which , in 2005 , did not want to expand the EU &apos;s long-term budget .
Added to that are the complex needs of the sectors in the industry , of which there are at least three : the in-patent sector , the generic sector and the over-the-counter sector .
( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , negotiations have reopened with the Mercosur countries , and , if I interpret today &apos;s criticisms correctly , the main issue is that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development was not informed .
I personally was most surprised to read that late payments were one of the main reasons for bankruptcies in Europe .
We made clear to President Putin our wish to have a close energy relationship with such a key partner , but that relationship must be based on the principles that Russia has already signed up to at the G8 hosted by Russia this year , as well as the energy charter : transparency , the rule of law , reciprocity and non-discrimination , along with market opening and market access .
I would like to underline that it is absolutely necessary to strengthen the political content of the Convention , meaning greater emphasis on the promotion of democracy , the rule of law , human rights and the prevention of conflicts , but it is also and especially important to try to develop a common strategy between the European Union and the ACP countries , a strategy aimed at taking on more effectively the challenges of globalization .
The system of trading rights , as established in Kyoto , is immoral and cynical , because it allows the worst to borrow from those who are only mediocre .
In our opinion , the rapporteur &apos; s report is an improvement on the Commission proposal , but it fails to sufficiently underscore the said points .
author . - Mr President , let me commence by stating that I am speaking in a personal capacity on this topic .
It is , however , the agreement that was possible under the current circumstances .
( EL ) Madam President , I have listened twice to Mr Barroso , once in plenary and once at a conference with the European United Left , and I have read his planning positions .
My fear - even if you shake your head , Mr Prodi - is that this will translate into what some countries have thought for years , that the Commission should be a simple secretariat for the Council of Ministers .
We condemn all external intervention and call for all governments to stand by the side of the grass-roots forces in Columbia so that the bloodshed and the activities of the paramilitary forces stop , peace is protected and human rights are respected .
I know that the economy is largely about psychology , and that we must try to restore confidence , but , ultimately , when the crisis worsens to the point where all the Member States are plunging further into recession and unemployment is dramatically rising , hearing the Council declare that it is confident about the EU economy &apos;s medium- and long-term prospects and that it is determined to do everything it takes to revive employment and growth , is all the same rather astounding .
in writing . The Spanish peace process is a brave and necessary initiative .
However , once the decision was made to draft a report , we simply decided to cooperate in a constructive manner with a view to achieving a good content .
Such a concept is also an extremely difficult one because it has to be translated into what Mr Davies mentioned .
This false assumption , which is still very much prevalent because the exchange rate between the euro , the dollar and the yen has , I regret to say , developed rather differently than appeared would be the case on 4 January , must not , however , lead to a situation in which erroneous ideas as to the value of the euro hold sway .
First of all I , too , would like to thank Mr Bowis for the opportunity to speak on this very important topic .
I wish to stress that Prime Minister Bülent Ecevit clearly reconfirmed , at Helsinki , Turkey &apos; s commitment to reform and meet the Copenhagen criteria .
President-in-Office of the Council . - Mr President , I think all of those who have spoken have spoken very much in strong terms in favour of the defence of democracy and constitutional order throughout Latin America .
I welcome this European Parliament resolution because I consider it to be the correct next step following the recent resolutions on the death penalty in China , Nigeria , North Korea and Iran .
The second comment is that this procedure - this new focus - requires the Member States to be monitored at a global level .
The report points to the great latent potential of possible reciprocal economic arrangements based on an equal partnership between both sides .
B4-1042 / 97 by Mr Gunther and Mrs Oomen-Ruijten , on behalf of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party , on the convention of Ottawa on a total ban on anti-people mines ; -B4-1051 / 97 by Mr Bertens , on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal , Democratic and Reformist Party , on the Ottawa Treaty on anti-people mines ; -B4-1059 / 97 by Mr Carnero González and others , on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left , on the Ottawa Treaty on the prohibition of the use , stockpiling , production and transfer of anti-personnel mines and on their destruction ; -B4-1063 / 97 by Mr Hory and others , on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Alliance , on the results of the Ottawa Conference on anti-people mines ; -B4-1072 / 97 , by Mr Cunningham and others , in the name of the Group of the Party of European Socialists , on the Ottawa Treaty on the prohibition of the use , stockpiling , production and transfer of anti-personnel mines and on their destruction ; -B4-1076 / 97 by Mr Azzolini and others , on behalf of the Group Union for Europe , on banning anti-people mines ; -B4-1081 / 97 by Mr Telkämper and others , on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament , on the Ottawa Treaty on the use , stockpiling , production and transfer of anti-personnel mines and on their destruction .
The next item is the recommendation for second reading ( A5-0026 / 1999 ) , on behalf of the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport , on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council Decision establishing a single financing and programming instrument for cultural cooperation ( Culture 2000 programme ) &#91; 13328 / 2 / 1998 - C5-0023 / 1999 - 1998 / 0169 ( COD ) &#93; ( rapporteur : Mr Graça Moura ) .
Like the rapporteur , I also hope that this omission will be rapidly rectified by the Commission , as well as the omission of any reference to the Regional Advisory Councils ( RACs ) .
They are on the move through desperation , but what unites them all is hope for something better .
We need to intervene with prevention policies and with suitable forestry policies - and by prevention I also mean intervening by means of a precise , thorough and targeted campaign against all forms of speculation directly or indirectly linked to these disasters - but I think that we also need to ensure broader , easier and quicker access to essential resources in order , at least , to mitigate the devastating effects of these disasters .
That is one of the most dramatic consequences of policies based on financial profitability which , at the same time , scandalously encourage real estate speculation and increase unemployment , precariousness and exclusion .
Every region should choose three to five of the 10 sectors offered by the Commission in which to concentrate 100 % of the available support .
We have insisted on this throughout , as well as urging that the proposal should be submitted to public consultation .
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , the Commission is paying close attention to the democratic and human rights situation in Egypt , which is one of our partners in the European neighbourhood policy .
Mr Speciale , I note that we agree entirely on the political objective .
We also received notification that a high-ranking Burmese delegation is in Brussels .
Mr President , I would like to thank you for this debate .
Mrs D &apos;Ancona , I would remind you that I asked you for information on the matter , and you told me in a letter that it was not a delegation from your committee .
Is it not so , that the only language Israel understands is if we resort to concrete sanctions , such as in the economic area ?
I can assure this House , not least on the basis of the strength of opinions articulated within this Chamber on the matter , that we are making continuing efforts to increase the transparency of the Council .
One-time Communists quickly found their feet in this new situation .
May I first of all congratulate the rapporteur , Mrs Billingham .
in writing . - ( HU ) I welcome the intention of the European Commission to provide more resources for strengthening freedom , security and law in the draft budget for next year .
How is it with this then ?
The cooperation that exists already between Parliament and industry has been impressive .
Breeding should essentially be an agricultural activity , not an industrial one .
All too often in these architectural situations everybody goes by the textbook , and when you look and ask a disabled person afterwards what the textbook solution is like , firstly , invariably it is more expensive than what disabled people want themselves , and , secondly , it is actually not right for what they require themselves .
That is of course permissible , and we are happy to take that on board , but we will - and I am sure that you will understand this - have to obtain information about other systems , some of which work and some of which do not , before we can come to a decision on a proper common approach for the whole of the EU .
There are many people and , I hope , an increasingly large group of people who will take a different view .
Nevertheless I should like to comment on industrial policy and consultation of the workforce on the basis of this morning &apos;s debate which he attended .
The single market if it is to be consolidated , must be underpinned by a strong and stable European currency .
Despite all this , I fear that what is proposed will not succeed in attracting small and mediumsized enterprises unless the way in which such contracts are to work is made clear , especially in a cross border context , and unless further clarification is provided on certain procedural aspects , including provisions on State aid and intellectual property , so as to create a transparent and stable environment for public bodies and enterprises .
Various regulations being introduced today will , in fact , need to be repealed as quickly as possible once the market starts functioning .
It must be remembered that this was not our only crisis .
Mr President , Mrs Halonen , Mr Prodi , we Finns know that we do not give thanks when there are good grounds for doing so , but we are quick to criticise .
( FR ) Mr President , I have now been told on two occasions that an oral question concerning the referendum on the future of South Sudan will not be reinstated in the order of business .
The Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left proposes that a Commission statement on the situation in South-East Turkey be added as the first item on Thursday &apos;s agenda , ending with a vote on a resolution .
What has become apparent is something of which one gets a sense in today &apos;s sitting , namely that those who call for transparency often , at the end of the day , do not want the facts to come out , and - as the rapporteur has observed - it sometimes turns out that the facts are not quite so scandalous and not quite so extraordinary as what they would have liked to see in the newspapers , but the Committee on Budgetary Control , the rapporteur and the working party have acquired these documents by honest means , and they stand by them .
With regard to that , I would therefore like to welcome the Commission &apos;s proposal for a Blue Card .
They do not believe that the two additives can be treated on a par with each other , as the Commission is doing .
Therefore , I cannot give you authoritative information on the actions of the European Patent Office in this particular case .
Mr President , I want to raise the fact that this House is set to debate the World Summit on the Information Society in Tunis only next month .
I am convinced this is still the case , and that it is useful for the European Union to have a fiscal framework .
We have to await the decisions that they will make in due course .
Where does the truth lie ?
While the common position contains improvements vis-à-vis the first proposal submitted by the Commission , there is still an absence of provisions relating to the safeguarding of evidence of the origin of genetic material , which is especially important for the diversity of species and for animal protection .
In the case of frozen raspberries , Poland has increased its market share in the last few years , at the expense of imports from third countries .
As such , the next phase in Nairobi , the meeting between the armed troops on 20 September , is probably more crucial than Arusha .
Another key aspect of information policy of the EU institutions is access to documents , and as I repeatedly noted in connection with the adoption of Regulation No 1049 / 2001 on public access to documents of the institutions , documents - and I stress this - cannot be separated from the information contained in them .
They fund basic services such as healthcare , education , social care and pensions .
That would make housing available for the Serbs who want to return .
To this end , we need swifter coordination within the European Union .
As you are aware , the Commission initiated a complementary risk assessment on these hormones in the light of the clarifications regarding risk assessment provided by the appellate body of the WTO .
I would like to end with the remark , as his mother declared with great dignity at his funeral , that while Matub may no longer be with us in person , his songs and poems will remain deep in our hearts for ever and his struggle for peace will continue .
Nonetheless , my decision has been made extraordinarily difficult .
If this proposal is accepted by the Council , in the form in which we adopted it , the quality image of European wines will be preserved .
However , there are two principles to which I want to give particular attention . The first principle is adherence to general ethical guidelines , which are also binding on EU researchers , and especially Euratom &apos;s .
I am also grateful to all the staff of the committee for their help and I hope that this cooperation will continue .
Nonetheless , leaving debt cancellation aside , there was a five billion increase in the actual aid provided to poor countries last year .
Hence we need to provide ourselves with a means of prevention and repression , while bearing in mind what is , as far as I am concerned , of primordial importance in the Schengen system , i.e. protection of privacy and protection of data .
in writing . - The potential agreement covers a wide range of issues : trade in goods and services , intellectual property rights , public procurement , regulatory cooperation , investment , temporary migration ( mode IV ) , competition policy and labour and environmental standards .
Clearly , if the wise sayings &quot; Whoever breaks it pays for it &quot; or &quot; Polluter pays &quot; crop up in a discussion on the cost of the roads , then , apart from anything else , there needs to be fewer heavy goods vehicles and more rail transport in the Alpine region in future .
Both parties in the region must be aware that they are pursuing a policy that is not only causing their peoples serious harm , but increasingly also causing problems for the whole international community and endangering peace in general - as this is not just a localised conflict .
Agricultural policy is no longer really enough to ensure the development of rural areas : a broad and manysided rural policy is needed .
Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Mennea , for this extremely valuable report .
Unfortunately , public opinion surveys confirm that the majority of these people will never become Latvian patriots , but the majority of them are already patriots of another country .
I would like to ask you : What is the situation with financial liabilities ?
On this point I can confirm that the Commission has carefully checked for compliance with this principle during the ex-ante review of new programmes for the period 2000-2006 .
It is almost the reverse , because the national quotas account for just over one per cent .
Are we all nuts ?
On the other hand , packages offered by agencies carry added costs in order to ensure compliance with this directive , while those purchased online do not carry such expenses .
( SV ) I would like to begin by thanking Claudio and everyone else who made this report possible .
Furthermore , I urge the Commission to investigate the possibility of compensation for hard-pressed British beef farmers , many of them driven almost to the wall by the beef ban .
It is no exaggeration to say that water will be the most important strategic asset of the 21st century .
. Mr President , first of all , I should like to thank Commissioner Dimas for the realistic contribution he made a moment ago .
I agree with the previous speakers that the United States of America , China , India , Brazil and other countries need to participate .
Europe has without hesitation adopted costly and difficult solutions in order to reduce agricultural surpluses and prevent the depopulation of rural areas .
To hear Mr Méndez de Vigo speak about it , you would think it was about this House renouncing its loyalty to the Convention and setting out on the treacherous ice of compromise .
Do you believe this is a possibility ?
Women played a crucial role , let us not forget , in the success of the Bonn talks in December and we will be doing what we can to support the Afghan Ministry of Women &apos;s Affairs which will , I hope , be a good example of women managing programmes to help develop society and to help protect the role of women in a society which has abused them for far too long .
Mr President , I would like to start by thanking Mrs Valenciano Martínez-Orozco for her work , which followed on a resolution supported by 316 Members .
I believe that the tax must be levied where the transaction takes place , and must also , in other words , benefit the States on whose territory the relevant stock exchanges are located .
If we want to make trade freer , the aim of all these efforts - both here and in our neighbouring countries to the south - must be to combat unemployment .
I am also extremely concerned about how the institutions are going to deal with proposals for funding the administrative costs .
A debate has commenced . The governments of the Member States have an obligation to get together in Vienna and begin outlining new directions for the European Union .
We must hold calm , objective discussions on the state of nuclear power in Europe and on the means to ensure maximum security .
Last year &apos;s biodiversity communication represents a first attempt by the European Union to set out a coherent response to the problem of biodiversity loss .
This would greatly promote the formation of opinions and therefore also the subsequent negotiations with the Council .
Nevertheless , I would call on the Commission to pursue this objective energetically .
The EIT is an important initiative and a suitable structure needs to be found for it .
I am talking , of course , about enlargement , which ought to be taken into account when we are considering European Capitals of Culture , hence the Commission proposal which we are debating today .
A great deal of the work that the Agency , too , has done , will simply be undone if we do not set clear European objectives to ensure that the path towards EU membership is clear .
Some give the impression that we have to decide between a Community development policy and the policies of the Member States , between those who would like to centralise development policy at European level and those who believe solely in bilateral cooperation .
You are asking , for example , that they should close in the north of Finland in order not to create problems for workers in Brussels .
Now we are told by Mr Byrne that we need just a few extra days of discussions .
Greater attention should also be paid to the innovative capacity of SMEs .
It has been a pleasure to work with all of you on the drawing up of this 2005 draft budget , which I hope can be voted for on Thursday without too many problems .
Or does it want to follow the example of Romania and resolutely tread the long and difficult road of economic reforms and closer cooperation with the European Union ?
I turn now to the question of import controls . This may not be what you want to hear , Mrs Redondo Jiménez , but products that are imported through Spanish ports or via any other border post in Spain by train or lorry have to be checked at the border to ascertain whether they meet plant health and veterinary requirements .
It could at least correct some of the excesses .
This is why we have been consistently committed , from the very beginning of our Presidency , to making the role played by the Quartet ( including its role on the ground ) more effective as the driving force behind negotiations between the two parties and , at the same time , to reinforcing the credibility and authority of the European Union &apos;s action within the Quartet .
After all , the key problems surrounding traffic still exist .
Mr President , I should just like to put one more question in view of the reply given by the Commissioner . Does the Commissioner think that the report in its present form , and it is likely to be adopted unanimously in this form , is in line with the proposal for a directive as a result of the Kalanke ruling , and does the Commissioner think this report is in line with the Court &apos;s ruling discussed here today ?
In short , a tangible objective is to aim for 75 % female employment by 2020 or to reduce the salary gap to zero or to a maximum of 5 % ; something for which we have been asking for a long time .
My fellow-Commissioner Mr Špidla and I are meeting more and more business people who are getting committed to and involved in making Europe a front-runner where CSR is concerned , and who see it as putting their businesses at a definite advantage on the market .
I hope that today , after many months of work , negotiation and seeking a consensus , this Parliament will take a decision on the report which has been admirably well drawn up by Karl von Wogau , and which represents one more step forward in the process of constructing an economic and monetary Europe , and furthermore , is an important step within the framework of the process started at the Lisbon European Council aimed at achieving greater flexibility , competitiveness and growth and creating jobs .
But there are some things we do not know . We are putting our faith in Russia , which is right .
I hope that this desire for agreement , which took shape in December , is respected today by all our colleagues .
Does that cost too much as well ?
It is noted that public procurement procedures must be more rational .
Perhaps the gradual approach that has been chosen , whereby the toughest issues are left until last , should be rethought .
As a result , the Union is obviously extremely keen to remain at the forefront in this age of information .
The Commission tabled some excellent proposals on the trans-European networks in the initial stages of the consultation and we should revert to them .
There must be equal opportunities for the &apos; Yes &apos; and &apos; No &apos; sides when we resume the constitutional process under the German Presidency .
I say this because our committee too was involved in this matter .
. ( PT ) As we all know , this proposal for a directive has been under discussion since 1970 and , despite the very basic agreement concluded at the Nice European Council , with the creation of a regulation on the statute and a proposal on the involvement of workers , the first step was nevertheless taken to make the European Company a legal entity .
I know that the Council has not discussed this issue , but I would put the following consideration to the President-in-Office . Joining the EU is an act of free will .
Social protection and social inclusion help to combat poverty and exclusion in preventive health care and many other areas , and are among the most important challenges for the future .
Thirdly , temporary workers work temporarily by choice and sometimes they can earn more money as temporary workers in an agency capacity .
Mr President , we talked in detail this morning about the problems that Parliament has had with the Council during this procedure , and about the Council &apos;s unwillingness , as part of the budgetary authority , to be reasonable in trying to find common ground with Parliament .
Both of these would be advantageous for the European Union &apos;s development , so why do we have to put obstacles in the way of making them a reality ?
Ladies and gentlemen , I would like to mention an issue which has so far not come up in this debate as we have , of course , been discussing the crimes related to the elections which took place a few days ago in Belarus .
It is debatable what the reasons are why this epidemic hit poor countries especially hard , compared with how it affected countries in our own part of the world .
The report &apos;s second important issue concerns the significant effect of the rapidity of technological developments .
Mr President , I believe Mr Belder has just hit the nail on the head .
We are going to have to compete more with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe , and this is why it is vital that we should not go back to needing state aid to compensate for poor competitiveness .
A number take the plunge and have recourse to cosmetic surgery .
And it is here that this pressure has proven to be useful , and I hope that Mr Swoboda and also the European Commission and the Presidency will continue to insist on the policy that unilateral actions of the Republic of Croatia regarding the determination of frontiers with neighbouring countries shall not be rewarded .
The Chilean encaja would achieve better results .
We should work together to ensure the existence of conditions which enable people to earn enough to participate in the life of society and to support their family , especially where they have many children .
Consequently , where the use of books is concerned , the educational system can contribute much , either positively as I believe happens in Finland , or negatively as I believe happens in Greece .
I believe that this is not right .
I endorse the rapporteur &apos;s view that this directive will benefit users and producers of labour-intensive services in Europe .
We are categorically opposed to the death penalty , regardless of what crimes the accused may be guilty of .
I would like to build on that beautiful thought by saying that until recently we could only listen to what the candidates and thereafter new members of the European Union expected from it .
The Russian Federation must therefore work very closely with the Court , and must respect the Court &apos;s judgments .
Finally , I should like to ask the European Commission , namely Mrs Wallström , when she will be reviewing the batteries directive .
Therefore , it makes a positive contribution to the future development of the European budget .
And was it not also discussed that you personally - and here I believe you - would make every effort to support this and to present a result to the House ?
Thirdly , I wonder whether we have the capacity to give an appropriate welcome to the candidate countries next year .
I can just about support the compromise , but I would have wished for more .
One last point , which is also crucial : we do not want fragmentation of the law .
Let me highlight some of these areas .
Perhaps we should call it the &apos; water baby &apos; , and he will be heartened to see his &apos; baby &apos; at last christened by this Parliament before he leaves us later this year .
I am also grateful to our Commission colleagues , who provided us with a great deal of information and were most understanding , although I very much regret - as did the entire committee - that one Commission colleague decided in the end that none of the amendments was acceptable .
An IGC with a more democratic flavour and less diplomatic style will be more successful and much quicker in reaching a conclusion .
The EPLP believes that unanimity cannot solely be restricted to constitutional items , as issues including tax and social security must be dealt with at national level .
B5-0045 / 2003 by Mr Lagendijk , Mr Turmes , Mrs Ahern , Mr Gahrton , Mrs Schroedter , Mr Wuori and Mrs Maes , on behalf of the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance : North Korea ;
We are here today to debate , and come to a decision about , the Council &apos;s Common Position of last October .
I think I can say that the PPE-DE Group comprises not only supporters of Amendment 1 but also a number of opponents .
I understand that it is of course a very difficult dossier for the Member States , too , but we in the European Parliament have shown that , despite starting from very different positions , it is possible to come closer on very important issues .
Mr President , the fight against terrorism is necessary , but not all means are permitted .
In accordance with Article 10 of this regulation the Commission submitted a report on its implementation . In the light of that exercise we proposed the definitive regulation in January 1998 .
On this latter point we are reflecting on whether it might be useful to adopt a framework regulation which makes common provision on leading issues like pay , conditions , staff representation rights and so on , but enables the different institutions to operate implementing rules on other matters .
Economic renewal , a fitter Europe - which is indispensable - Europe as a global player not only in economic terms , a Europe that wants to be a success and will be one - only by maintaining internal social cohesion can these things be achieved .
Today , we must not yield to the dictates of Communist mainland China .
We know what we have to do : to get loans flowing again ; to keep people in jobs ; to improve their skills for when the upturn comes ; to continue to invest in productivity and European competitiveness .
This means that there are countries where pesticide use must be genuinely reduced and countries where pesticide use should even be increased .
Even though we are able to endorse by far the majority of the report &apos; s recommendations , we have not been able to vote in favour of the report , partly because quite a few of the proposals are too vague and partly - and especially - because the proposals are based upon asylum and immigration policy &apos; s being defined supranationally by the EU .
As you know , in many of the areas investigated by the Committee , the European Union does not itself have any power to act .
Mr President , I would really like to repeat what I said last year .
Kosovo , in particular , represents a major problem for us in this regard .
The European Union must demonstrate more courage , more determination in this delicate matter , that is it needs to move from words to deeds , if only through the establishment of a European participation council , with the task of promoting the introduction of participation systems under comparable conditions throughout the Community .
On one hand , we point out the costs , and the benefits , with the Commission itself stating that the current budgetary situation is such that with the cost of current agreements we have very little room for manoeuvre when negotiating new agreements or renegotiating existing ones .
Mr President , I do not propose to speak on this sad event - which naturally grieves me as well - but I regret that I have to report to my fellow Members in this House , particularly the ladies , the death , in this case from natural causes , of Carmen Llorca Vilaplan , who was a Member of this House for many years and worked hard here , especially in the fields of culture and women &apos;s rights .
Madam President , I just wish to address a word of thanks to both the Dutch presidency and the Commission and add a sentence with a question to each of them to take away with them .
Alternatively , it might be the users of ratings who pay .
During the consultation process we received more than 1 , 000 written replies from national governments , from European bodies , from national professional bodies , from consultants or from individual companies .
The average age of patients participating in clinical trials of treatments for high blood pressure is 63 , yet 44 % of patients are older than 70 when first diagnosed with this problem .
I have a lot of empathy and support for the farming industry , and I know that many of them recognise that serious and considered reform is necessary to ensure that the sugar sector is prepared for the demands of the future .
The second recommendation is for the elaboration of an EU action plan with clear objectives and tasks , including regular ministerial-level meetings of the relevant countries .
How many of the 100 veterinary inspectors that the Commission recently appointed have gone into action ?
Aware of the importance of renewing this agreement and following the mandate conferred upon it by the Council , the Commission has negotiated a new protocol , which was concluded on 15 July 2010 .
I look forward to statements by the Commissioner .
The points I would underline in his report are as follows : in paragraph 4 he makes the very important point about the European civil service .
I agreed with this document , because the Commission has informed Parliament in its proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on the mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund ( COM ( 2011 ) 0010 ) that , on the basis of applications for assistance by Poland , Slovakia , Hungary , the Czech Republic , Romania and candidate country Croatia relating to the flooding disasters of May , June and July 2010 , it proposes the mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund .
Studying the 2008 report of the European Ombudsman , we see that , unfortunately , the objective of applying the principle enshrined in Article 41 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights is still far from being met .
Therefore , as a matter of principle , we are not in favour of having an ad hoc debate which this House is not prepared for .
Laying staff off is always the worst way to handle it , and it is one to which they must not have recourse .
More and more Union policies are taking account of the need to develop education systems which respond to the potential of the new economy .
In this respect , I believe it is a mistake to turn to large projects .
We are all aware that the population of the European Union is living longer and ageing .
There will be a full enquiry .
The experience in Yugoslavia in particular , where it was not &apos; peacefulness &apos; and &apos; modesty &apos; that led to the reserved attitude of the European states , but &apos; cynicism &apos; and &apos; indifference &apos; , taught us this at the time .
On Amendment No 16 on gender mainstreaming , the Commission accepts this amendment partially and in spirit , but only to the extent that it respects the wording of the Treaty .
One such measure , the strengthening of the unit which administers the NGO cofinancing budget with a number of auxiliary staff , has already had effects this year : firstly , the funds available for NGO cofinancing will have been utilized in their entirety this year and , secondly , the delays in monitoring the projects funded have been made good .
In terms of what is taking place in Israel , I will tell you that this afternoon I had a telephone conversation with the new Foreign Minister , Mr Netanyahu .
To me , this means that April seems to be the ultimate date for reaching a decision .
Yes , there is more progress , although this broadband of foreign policy of the Union is not sufficiently big enough , and here I refer to your words , Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner , on money .
The Barroso II Commission , as the election of its President showed , is a continuation of the previous Commissions , the neoliberal policies of which led the EU into a situation of long-term economic , social and environmental crisis that is henceforth its own .
Madam President , the European Union &apos;s positive role in dealing with any conflict in the world and our role in relation to Kashmir should be to support peace processes and to uphold international law .
That also applies to the measures for consolidating the budgets of the individual Member States of the euro area .
The report proves beyond all doubt that the reform process is long overdue .
Everybody agrees about this , but nothing is happening .
That is an intelligent proposal and one that is deserving of support .
Will the Commission insist that all Member States conduct the stress tests properly , and do not do their own lightweight version ?
Next month the Pakistani Senate will be voting on this amendment .
This is why we want to draw attention to the fact that the establishment of a smoothly running market economy often degenerates into nothing more than an insistence on rapid privatisation .
The issue of the EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator has already been raised .
Madam President , Commissioner , I would like to start by briefly praising Mr Karas &apos; excellent work .
I could do that too , but it would change nothing .
I hope that in future the EU will ensure that there is no doubt about Kosovo &apos;s compliance with international humanitarian and human rights law .
Yet when a EU Member State re-introduces internment without trial and abolishes the right to judicial review , we remain silent and condone the kind of treatment that undermines civil liberties and totally ignores the European Convention on Human Rights .
In connection with the hysteria which broke out after the earthquake in Japan and the problems concerning the reactor at the Fukushima power plant , the citizens of certain EU Member States decided to move away from nuclear energy within a relatively short space of time , although there are still no signs of any generalised problem .
By facilitating travel and contacts between the Union and Belarus , we can undermine the Lukashenko regime much more effectively than with dozens of statements or resolutions .
Let me conclude with three specific points which are touched upon in your report as well as the Ombudsman &apos;s Annual Report .
The Italian government waited for the opinion of the European Parliament on both the Single Act and the Maastricht Treaty . Furthermore this pledge was confirmed by the 1989 referendum , under which national decisions are subordinated to supranational decisions .
Secondly , there will be more competition in the internal market , which will also benefit consumers , be they individuals or companies .
The innovation and participation programme for small and medium-sized companies should be attentive to this as part of its co-ordinating and supporting role , while carrying out its own activities .
Definition by the Commission of the circumstances under which it may be applied is appropriate and desirable for Member States in advance of them preparing their national allocation plans .
Europe has to provide answers here , because families are far more important than we tend to realise .
Mr President , today we have to decide which type of direction to give to state aid in the future , how to involve the territory and categories as well as the controls and exemptions to be applied .
I would be interested to know if there any plans to improve matters in this respect .
However , at that time , Austria was one of the countries that worked particularly effectively and closely with the European Parliament .
The first relates to the right of asylum , its unique characteristics and all the other rights that correspond to it .
This is the price to pay for creating Europe , since students who have got to know another country within the framework of Erasmus , who have made friends in another country , at another university , are the true Europeans who will make European policy tomorrow .
I have stated on many occasions that it is unacceptable to plan the future of our finances on the basis of a simple percentage point .
The Commission is ready to contribute to a possible peace package .
Therefore , as the Presidency-in-Office has stated , we hope that the Madrid Summit will be able to send a clear and well-defined message of the Europe &apos; s new commitment to Latin America .
The proposal for harmonisation is , of course , heading in the right direction , since it is seeking to halt the downward spiral in the conditions in which asylum applicants are received in Europe .
Therefore you have to go down in a lift to the ground floor and cross across the buildings outside or inside and get to another lift and go up there to get from one side of the building to another .
It is the second time I have found them not here on an important occasion .
As the Member who has just spoken has said , we are undergoing a universal process of globalisation .
Rather , you were inspired by the common European good ; and , although , on certain points , we did not always follow up your proposals because we were seeking balanced , compromise solutions , you have nonetheless inspired many of our advances , particularly in the area of social governance .
The ongoing work on a new treaty does not involve plans to amend the &apos; institutional framework &apos; , resulting in a deterioration of the status of the European institutions &apos; external auditor .
( RO ) I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteurs for the results they achieved in negotiating the 2010 budget .
I believe that it is better to cut down consumption , which is also a good guiding principle in life generally .
He had no objections to international assistance and monitoring , nor to the presence of international observers during the elections .
According to Article 1 ( g ) of Annex III the notice of the open comeptition may if appropriate state an age limit imposed to take account of special situations .
What lies behind this is shown by the example of the financial support given to institutions , which , although a central instrument of Community expenditure , were subject to no rules whatever prior to the Commission &apos;s first Vademecum in 1999 .
Ladies and gentlemen , I could continue with an endless catalogue of prevention and care issues .
It is a doctrine of internal security services that any population is only three days away from riots and civil unrest when the food supplies run out .
We are part of a Union , and our economies are interlinked in a number of ways : through the single market and , in many cases , through the sharing of the common currency and the deeper economic integration which that implies .
The next item is the debate on the report by Giusto Catania , on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , on the Future of the European Common Asylum System .
The rapporteur raised the issue of employment very forcefully ; it is just as important in the applicant countries as it is in the European Union .
- Mr President , I wish to thank Mrs Redondo Jiménez for her splendid work in drawing up the report on the Forest Focus programme .
I sometimes think they are not , but that is something we can discuss .
How can we not take into account the human factor in accidents at sea ( 80 % of these accidents are due to human error ) .
Parliament &apos;s resolution includes the suggestion that &quot; European citizenship &quot; should be a &quot; standard element in school curricula throughout the EU &quot; .
However , the Commission is in the hands of the Council and we can do no more than help the Council as much as possible to reach an agreement .
In this debate , I should like to make three appeals .
Mr President , Mr Commissioner , first of all I want to explain that I am speaking on behalf of Mrs Baldi , who could not be here this evening and has given me her notes , because she has followed this dossier .
To protect human health and the environment , it is vital to help change the approach to agricultural pesticides .
Against this background , I cannot understand - and nor can nearly all my colleagues here in the House - why the Council has cut back the original proposals of the Commission and Parliament quite considerably in its common position .
Enabling citizens to live longer certainly represents an achievement for the Member States of the Union .
All these agreements were forged , Mr President , on the understanding that if any person physically , legally or morally belonging to the European Union was affected , or if the conceded annulments did not happen or were altered , the European Union reserved the automatic right to re-initiate the normal WTO complaint procedure .
The different reports include best practices for national Member States .
The Basel Committee will work on quantitative retention . This has been required by the G20 .
I am grateful to Mr Takkula , to my fellow Members in all the groups , as well as to the Commission and Council , for the good working relationship we have enjoyed in dealing with this dossier .
There are many countries where democracy and human rights are in a precarious position .
That will also require progress regarding marine areas that lie beyond national jurisdiction .
It is a disgrace , and the EU must call upon the world community to accept responsibility for stopping the destruction .
In the case of failure , the Western countries might become reluctant to engage in future conflict prevention and resolution interventions and in peace-keeping operations .
Last year , the EU &apos;s Heads of State or Government pledged to play a leadership role on the climate front - that represents a commitment .
But , as you all know , our funds within the rural development policy are limited .
Nevertheless , I have taken note of your wish and the Commission will consider your proposal with interest . In any event , we understand the reasons behind it .
The Commission has failed to grasp their great significance .
Whilst the world witnessed scenes of desperate people on rooftops and in trees , aid had already got under way off camera .
New ways of capital procurement are currently a top priority for the SME sector .
High-level governmental visits have also been suspended .
Can I assure the minister that we all want to look after the citizens &apos; health and the environment , but does the Council agree with the call for a European Commission impact assessment on the effects of food production and food supply because of this legislation in each Member State ?
Only with these and additional safeguards proposed by Parliament will citizens accept the collection of data .
When the leitmotif of the resolution was the merger of the Lisbon Strategy and the Sustainable Development Strategy , we had difficulty voting for it , but we now think that there is an acceptable compromise .
It would not call into question the honesty of what was done previously .
Although the European Union &apos;s strategy , which involves supporting the Sudan to the tune of EUR 400 million , is the right response , it is necessary , above all , that the release of these resources be made conditional upon the implementation of the peace treaty and , in particular , on the improvement of the situation in the south-western province of Darfur .
That is what matters to us , nothing more or nothing less .
You know very well that there are five minutes available under the catchtheeye procedure and that Members who have not spoken in the debate have priority .
I believe that contracts of a similar type operate in Belgium .
Well , a large part of the resolution relates to socio-economic policy within the European Union or concerns recommendations on the introduction of the euro .
Thank you , Mr Posselt , for your comment which , I can assure you I have already noted and shall pass on .
In accordance with the wishes of Parliament , I will also give an account of the Presidency &apos; s views of the situation in Chechnya , and I will give an outline of the most important results of the OSCE Summit in Istanbul in November .
I am surprised , however , that some people are talking about referring the matter to the Court of Justice and that no one has ever considered referring to the Court of Justice other violations of the Treaty committed on an ongoing basis by practically all of the members of the euro zone , when they did not consider their economic policy to be an issue of common interest , as the Treaty suggests .
Basel II has not proved very effective as a crisis prevention mechanism .
A public bank like yours cannot respond to all the needs of the market , but you should be a catalyst : a catalyst to help our societies and economies transform , so that they can rise to the two crucial challenges of our time , which are not only to learn to live within the physical limits of our planet - that is , of course , the climate issue and that of the exhaustion of resources - but also to rise to this growing challenge of social cohesion , both within the European Union and on the planet as a whole , since you have a significant mission in the area of development .
If bulky manuals are needed in order to understand this Regulation , if a &quot; helpdesk &quot; is needed to come to the daily rescue of those officials who are lost in the maze of its procedures and if businesses , institutes , organisations , small farmers and Europeans cannot take advantage of all of the subsidies or participate in all of the markets , then it is quite simply because the Financial Regulation is based on the fundamental philosophical principle running throughout European integration : the smoke and mirrors principle which , in 1905 , the Italian financier Puviani called the financial illusions principle and which consists of using complexity to hide the truth - the European truth in this case .
Here , too , there is a task for the European Union .
Commissioner , you deal with taxes , what is the latest on this score ?
Secondly , there must be sufficient opportunity to make this clash visible in the public debate , which is achieved most effectively if , before the decisions are taken , the Members can react to each other or can ask for clarifications by means of interruptions and a second round of debate .
Mr President , in view of the importance of the matter , I would just like to ask the Commissioner to clarify something .
It is imperative that there be a positive outcome to it soon .
Mr President , there is one more wish I should like to express on the single market , namely that we continue in future to fight fraud and crime with the same efficiency as we have done to date , and that we set a good example of security in our own European house .
Cyclists and pedestrians must be able to proceed safely and quickly .
We now have to deal with the debate on REACH and on preventive research and research in favour of public health within the seventh framework programme , which should include these issues .
This , whilst looking good , does not benefit the people who pay for them - the taxpayers .
Following the reaffirmation of the commitment to full implementation of the Thessaloniki agenda and of the intention to honour the existing commitments made to the candidate and potential candidate countries with regard to future enlargement , we still have to ensure that the Union is able to function .
Neither are we against political parties !
Once again , what message would we send if we failed to conclude this conciliation with an agreement ?
Firstly , we should note the need to maintain the institutional balance enshrined in the Treaty , within which framework the European Commission proposes laws and Parliament and the Council adopt them .
Furthermore , these events took place within a context of general violence which has left a number of dead and wounded and thousands of refugees .
It must work to mobilise the UN , ASEAN and the USA to put pressure on China and India to end their support for the Burmese regime and to stop the arms trade going on , namely with North Korea .
I do not have much time so I will make just two comments .
As more authoritative colleagues who have been here longer have said , this is certainly not a new subject , but it is possible that because we have been talking about it for a long time and there is still a need for discussion , it means that there is no easy solution .
It is an imperfect plan , certainly , but it is a plan that the Sahrawi people have accepted , and they have given way significantly on some of their positions .
Mr Dess and I are particularly involved with the dialogue between these religions , which certainly has a good chance of success in that country - being an Arab country that is not Islamist and is very important throughout the region .
I do not feel that any of this has been given sufficient consideration in Mrs Roure &apos;s report .
To be continued ... but one truly does get the impression that these technical assistance activities are carried out to spend money , just because the legal basis exists .
It is not therefore surprising that he is holed in one .
We also know that a large part of health policy is further decentralised .
A number of lessons may be learnt from it as of now : firstly , regarding the timetable , secondly , regarding the scope of the reforms which must be implemented successfully and , finally , regarding the way in which these talks must be prepared .
I have a few reservations about some of the details , but on the whole it is an exceptionally good report .
The rapporteur has shown due regard to public concern in pushing the case for more environmentally friendly vehicles .
The Commission is insisting that the Albanian government should facilitate the work of the international administrators , and it is very important that these audits should produce results . That would allow the International Monetary Fund &apos;s emergency programme and the negotiations with the Fund to become a reality , which would of course set Albania into a pattern of normalization , at least with respect to its international economic relations .
This nuclear incident and its sad after-effects for certain individuals have wider implications for the health and safety of all our citizens .
Mr President , I think that Mrs De Keyser &apos;s report is very uneven .
The previous speaker &apos; s intervention was not translated properly because it was delivered too quickly , so I would ask future speakers to speak more slowly so that the interpreters can keep up .
I would also like to draw attention to the regrettable situation that has developed there .
We are now seeking the cooperation of the Council and Parliament in the course of consideration of the modernisation of the Staff Regulations next year .
In some Member States we already have a qualification problem , and part of the unemployment in Europe is due to the fact that certain qualifications are not available where they are actually needed .
Legal certainty should be considered whenever a piece of legislation is reviewed .
On the other hand , an agreement would give us a formal foundation for addressing Tehran on a permanent basis with regard to the social abuses cited by Mr Gahler .
To date , France is still in contravention of Community law , because the directive has still not been transposed .
That is the fundamental mistake in what is called the communitised agricultural policy .
At the very heart of that we find the Lisbon Agenda .
I shall continue to work in Parliament as a Member , and I can assure you that I shall continue to do so gladly with all of you , in the same spirit .
The opposite is true : it aims to strengthen the European pillar within the framework of the United Nations , and this goes without saying .
Finally , unlike the rapporteur , Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou , I wholeheartedly endorse Commissioner McCreevy &apos;s conclusions .
I am pleased that the committee has approved the report , after much deliberation , and I know , through colleagues from right across the committee , the painstaking work that was done to try and come forward with something that was acceptable .
With regard to this point , however , I must point out that there has been a change in the position of some delegations on the agricultural guideline , as well as on the question of shifting some fiscal burdens from the CAP purse back to the Member States .
Some of the elements of this report were taken on board .
However , the use of our intelligence is also necessary to undermine the sense of alienation and injustice felt by many of those who are recruited to commit these kinds of awful acts .
It has certainly been a lively debate .
I believe that the proposal and the proposed amendments are all in all an acceptable response to the public outcry on the mass culling of livestock .
We do not need the House of European History , as Europe is losing competitiveness and geopolitical weight .
I voted in favour of Parliament &apos;s resolution on Iraq , because I feel that Europe should set a firm example in condemning terrorist attacks against civilians , the police , soldiers from the multinational force and civilian hostages .
It is virtually impossible for them to continue their work .
We now have yet another new model , yet another different model , and once again a serious parliamentary dialogue has been dealt with only indirectly .
To name but one : after a re-examination of procurement by the European Network and Information Security Agency more weaknesses were found in this area .
This year Parliament voted to change a double partsession in the autumn to make it a weeklong sitting in Strasbourg .
In conclusion , allow me to say that the Belgian government has announced that it wishes to complete the preparations for the definitive Eurojust unit during its presidency .
( ES ) Mr President , Regulation ( EC ) No 1288 / 2009 extends the transitional technical measures so that they can be applied until the adoption of permanent measures .
This is made clear in the Green Paper as well .
The biggest achievement is the fact that the objectives and implementing principles are enshrined in legislation and everyone acknowledged the need to embark on a cleaner path of development .
However , even though some of these are urgent priorities , our first concern must be to use available resources to reinforce some of our existing delegations .
However , contrary to what was proposed by the Dutch presidency , the codecision procedure has not been adopted for the provisions of Article 130d concerning the Structural and Cohesion Funds .
Mr President , I would like to take this opportunity to inform the Commissioner that , together with the Interparliamentary Union , the European Parliament will , as we have done before , be staging an event in Cancun .
I think it is wrong to give strong support to this type of cultivation within the framework of agricultural policy .
We are in favour of signing an international treaty and , in the short term , we demand a programme for the medical examination of soldiers who have taken part in operations in the Balkans , members of humanitarian organisations who have worked in the field and the people living in the areas in question .
On this I agree with various fellow Members who have spoken and with the rapporteur herself on the need to take a broader view of the entire issue of testing seeds and plants .
Above all , it is up to the Somalis to solve their problems ; we could never do this for them .
We have all decided from time to time to change this course , to rally all the European nations around values and around principles .
We need to remember this : the agreement was concluded in 1975 , the Oslo Peace Accord was signed in 1993 , and from that moment on the European Union has supported the independence of the Palestinian Autonomy Authority , it has given it over EUR 2 billion and has done very good work .
In Europe , it claims 548.000 victims a year , or one every minute .
Given these conditions , I believe the promotion of the European Union as a political entity is the principal task we need to address .
I think that the European Union and its Member States must define and implement a principle of &apos; climate justice &apos; and , therefore , introduce an equity clause in future international climate negotiations .
I have therefore asked my political group to help me out by resubmitting the proposal for a European registration agency in the form of an amendment , and I urge all colleagues who originally may have differed on this point to think again .
We must also address an issue which was avoided at first reading , and that is the question of the control of the import and export of GMO crops and other GMO products .
It would also give us the opportunity to address some of the more risky businesses which the EIB - in line with banking logic - is not addressing .
As a result , I would like to announce that it has now been accepted by the European Parliament .
We have remained at a level well behind that of the US .
Mr President , for clarification , my group was also an author of this resolution but somehow we got dropped off the list .
But I have taken on board your suggestion and I will give it further consideration .
The truth is that a fair amount of time has passed since then and the development of the European Strategy for the Danube Region is still a work in progress , with very little known yet about its current status .
I would not like to see any misunderstanding arise here .
Mr President , Commissioner , the economic relations between the EU and Yugoslavia are of a special kind .
We on the Committee on Budgets have reached agreement on most areas .
The Commission recently published statistics on poverty in Europe which show that a considerable number of people live in relative poverty , in other words in comparison with the people around them .
Thirdly , would you also agree that this fund could be nothing other than a first step towards a real European treasury , which we need with economic and monetary union ?
It is clear that , on its own , the announcement that a European Research Area is to be established will change little .
. Mr President , I am pleased that the Council has dealt with this item as a matter of urgency .
I am taking this gamble , yes , because I believe that there are times in politics when we should follow the dictates of our hearts because our heads are not sure of the way .
Does the Commission intend to do this ?
Parliament , the Commission and the Council have in actual fact tackled the issue as a whole , and we are now perhaps putting the last pieces of the puzzle in place when it comes to thinking about food safety .
Furthermore , Amendment No 14 seeks to restrict the Commission &apos;s discretion under the Treaty to decide when to bring infringement proceedings .
It was a region which was not subject to the ordinary tax regime nor , therefore , the customs rules , owing to its great distance from Peninsular Spain .
Nonetheless , the basic message is absolutely correct and the Commission must adopt a much clearer approach here .
We must therefore try to improve the way spatial data is used and accessed , to facilitate the planning , implementation , monitoring and evaluation of policies .
I believe that , if Europe had succeeded in adopting an unambiguous position , that would have been a barrier to George Bush &apos;s war , but the European Union was divided when it came onto the scene and was therefore impotent and ineffective .
This statement , unfortunately for its author , amounts to an absolutely clear acknowledgement that the Commission is taking advantage of the many different hats it wears to confuse issues , at the risk of employing competition policy in the service of other objectives which it may have decreed are the objectives of the Treaty .
There are four high speed trains from the Netherlands to Paris alone every day .
The inspiration behind this report is the need to devise a different , and I hope more practical , approach to European Union policy on tourism , which is currently restricted by the provisions of the Treaty .
The labour force flow we are talking about is from the less developed countries to the more developed countries in the EU .
On behalf of the Socialist Group , I would like to offer you our support and I thank you for mentioning the Statute for Members of Parliament and parties , which is a sign of Greek capacity and wisdom .
In this regard , the open coordination method can help us , but we have no one single solution .
The point I have made is for future reference , so to speak .
- Mr President , Commissioner , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , I should like to begin by commending the Commission and the Luxembourg Presidency on their endeavours to prevent the European Council disaster .
There are three points I wish to raise .
This is the case , even if some of us do not like it very much .
We are now looking for an alternative , not as a blueprint , but as a line of thought and action , in order to give shape to our ideals of social justice and security for everyone .
The reform is based on mutual trust and close cooperation between the European Parliament , the Commission and the Court of Auditors .
The beginning of today &apos;s discussion is fantastic !
I believe there are projects such as the planned Europa Centre at As in the Czech Republic and many others .
But NATO is pursuing the opposite course , basing its new strategy on strength and displays of power outside the alliance &apos; s borders , which are steadily moving eastwards , and the EU is following in its wake .
The current crisis will have the effect of further restricting credit and it has already started to push prices up in anticipation , irrespective of the decision the Central Bank takes tomorrow .
Patients can , and should , in future ensure that they are not taking fake medicines by checking that all the safety features which will be required on future packaging are in fact in place .
The result achieved in the trialogue will create the preconditions for this .
These answers were quite correct : it is true that guarantees must be demanded and that this is a delicate issue .
In addition to adopting directives on access to information and on public participation , it has made significant progress , especially with the proposal for a regulation on the application of the Aarhus Convention to Community agencies .
So , what has been proposed today is something I support 100 % .
But there remains Mr Fassino &apos;s commitment to reply to Mr Falconer on a question left open from the previous Question Time .
A second lesson is broader , and that is the lesson that has been hotly debated in the Netherlands .
on behalf of the UEN Group . - ( PL ) Mr President , our civilisation lives from the exploitation of animals and will certainly long continue to do so .
In every other year , the rate of inflation has been more than 2 % .
Everything else , I regard as empty words .
We cannot refer to something as humanitarian action that is not necessarily what it seems .
We must also welcome the Commission &apos;s agreement with the Honduras Government on special treatment for these children .
It would be inadvisable to release these funds until the outstanding and unclear issues surrounding those premises have been satisfactorily clarified .
Of course it is always essential for us to continue evaluating the harmful effects , but we cannot overdo it .
Colleagues from the Green Group want considerably stricter limits on NOx and particulates ; these amendments are wellmeaning but absolutely unrealistic and were all defeated in committee .
It would be totally dominated by diplomats , technocrats and bureaucrats , with ministers occasionally flying into Brussels to try and keep track of what is happening .
In the past , the Commission has adopted decisions against them .
Based on the outcome of all the consultations , the Commission will carefully examine the economic and social impact on stakeholders , including the costs and benefits generated by the possible options .
As regards assessing and authorising hormone-treated beef from the USA , I would ask you to bear in mind that the reason we set up a multilateral legal framework was precisely to protect weaker states .
These will enable the best use to be made of airspace , taking account of air traffic flows and giving the various authorities the option to select a service provider of their own choosing .
The final ceiling on expenditure for the European Parliament &apos;s budget will be set at first reading .
And we must step up the fight against the big international traffickers by greater international cooperation and by doing away with tax havens , which only serve as centres for laundering the proceeds of drug and other illegal trafficking or allow speculators to avoid taxation .
I would once again call on the Commission and in particular President Santer to take a firm grip on this whole issue as a matter of urgency .
Despite agreeing that the modifications recommended by the Commission to the common agricultural policy are necessary , I feel that , with regard to milk quotas , the Commission proposal is very harmful to less competitive European regions which are heavily dependent on the milk sector .
This is a rule which has been applied in this case and also in other dubious cases , and I am referring to the presidency &apos; s interpretation in relation to the Ruiz Mateos case , which has been discussed here recently .
Energy is being dealt with as a commodity rather than as a common asset .
We are talking about a Europe that has achieved many great , useful things during the 50 years since the Community and Union were founded , a Europe that has achieved peace and prosperity and , most recently , established the single currency .
I hope that you , Commissioner Nielson , together with Commissioner Patten and Mr Solana , will be able to act in such a way as to inject new life into these discussions , partly in the light of the work on getting Iran to ratify and implement the Non-Proliferation Agreement .
It has now become necessary to devise a promotional campaign in order to allay the doubts and fears which , according to the media , have already arisen in certain academic circles .
I hope that the citizens of the applicant countries do not look at the two things side by side and become frustrated .
In paragraph 13 , the report suggests the need to strike a balance with regard to investors &apos; rights .
In the same way , I think that an assessment must be made of the enormous quantity of databases at our disposal .
I also take this opportunity to thank the President for her initiative to invite a number of presidents of parliaments as well as the Congress participants to attend the solemn appeal that took place in the European Parliament in Strasbourg on 22 June last .
It is interesting , however , that contrary to Russia &apos;s expectations pressure from Russia in connection with gas supplies and the blocking of exports from Ukraine directly fuelled support for the forces of democracy .
However , I maintain that the challenge of intermediate categories and the safeguard clause is one that we must take on in order to begin a new phase in Europe &apos;s cohesion policy and also to realise , within the cohesion policy , the more balanced and sustainable development that we want to assure for Europe over the coming years .
It is a country which is enjoying economic success and is regarded with some jealousy in the region , a country with a growing middle class and a growing financial élite which , in contrast to Latin America and Africa , invests its money in its own country .
It concentrates on national balances that lead to rivalry and that discourage solidarity . And , to top it all , it suggests cofinancing the CAP , an idea that was rejected by this very House in November and that was even rejected by the government that proposed it to the Council .
It would seem that many governments have not properly appreciated what the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) guidelines mean .
Let us consider for a moment where we would be today if we had not had this success .
We must cooperate internationally , and this should include UN initiatives .
Your Holiness , the European Parliament is with you .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mr Sichrovsky has just given us some food for thought .
A number of actions , such as an overall examination of safety measures and the safety pact between producers and importers , must be prioritised in order to restore consumer confidence .
I would point out that this compensation must be paid , in the event of cancellation or serious delays in journeys , within one month of the passenger &apos;s request .
At this very moment , I believe that awarding the Nobel Prize to Liu Xiaobo is an appropriate act to emphasise that , although China has made great progress in economic and sometimes in social matters , the real sign of progress is respect for human rights .
In the private sector as a whole there has been large-scale investment in the updating of information technology systems and the retraining of staff .
However , I am personally extremely concerned about what we did not do , and that is set priorities .
In the United States widespread criticism of methods adopted by the government in the fight against terrorism is evident , whether it is to do with the policy of detention without trial or the way in which the heavy hand of the state is being imposed in areas like this .
Traditionally , Parliament used to publish every year what bordered on a list of violations of human rights around the world , and ultimately failed in its objective to monitor the activities of the Community institutions .
In that way , within a reasonable space of time , we will be able to find the solutions to making European ports the centres of economic , social , technological and environmental development that Europe requires and , in view of the global framework , they will thereby contribute to better producing a more cohesive Europe .
President-in-Office of the Council . - ( FR ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , you have kindly waited for the Extraordinary European Council to end and so I have rushed here to present its results to you .
The situation is considerably worse in the candidate countries that will be joining the Union in May next year .
We can , and must , start the agricultural reform here , by turning this situation around again , because ultimately , the whole of agriculture suffers as a result of the damage caused here by a few criminals contaminating feed , and that is something that we must prevent as a matter of principle .
I am thinking in particular of the multi-fund approach , which makes it possible for the funds needed to implement a single task to be combined as effectively as possible at Member State level , or in other words for the money to be used as the country in question sees fit .
We must demand transparency , and we must demand that the existing European parties scrupulously observe rules and laws instead of cheating their way around them .
That is why it is important to cultivate a policy that strengthens democracy and prosperity in the Union &apos;s neighbouring regions .
Such is the purely technical background to my report , and I do of course fully agree with the Commission that adaptation is an important primary concern .
During the last part-session , a majority of Members of this House voted in favour of both my reports on the two Commission regulations .
I totally support this .
It would be appropriate to refer for this purpose to the concepts defined in Directive 2008 / 52 / EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2008 on certain aspects of mediation in civil and commercial matters and the European code of conduct for mediators .
That answers the earlier question by Mrs Banotti which I forgot to reply to .
In order to guarantee these regions development of enterprise , stimulation of professional activity and the same level in the agriculture sector as in the whole of Europe , we need to introduce new legislative concessions - and continue with those which already exist - adapted to the needs of specific regions .
Now , in parallel with the negotiations for the Fifth Lomé Convention , which opened on 30 September 1998 between the European Union and the ACP group , and the ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty , the future of the ultraperipheral regions and overseas countries and territories will begin to be considered .
Since the Commission and the committee responsible do not seem to share my view , I have chosen to vote against the report .
I should also like to comment on something Chris Patten quite rightly said about the unity of the European Union .
I also know that on account of the narrow majorities , we have lost at least the key topics by ten or so votes only .
I believe that we have achieved these objectives with the report .
Develop the EU guidelines around what individual Member States are already applying .
It should lead to the adoption of a common approach for reducing the social impact of the crisis , reaching a new consensus with the social partners and other participants over the question of modernising social policies and setting out concrete measures for speeding up economic recovery and overcoming the crisis through resolving structural shortcomings on the labour market .
I agree with the Commissioner that we should give people there as much autonomy as possible .
I fully agreed with the rapporteur &apos;s very positive assessment of the overall results achieved in 2001 , in terms of the initiative &apos;s development and its impact on employment .
My question , President Barroso , is this : do you , too , believe that we can really - and with a clear conscience - sell atomic energy to the citizens of Europe as a clean form of energy that is less damaging to the climate ?
Like her , I sincerely believe that we need to redeem and revive this principle , which as I have said before is that of action rather than abstention , and ensure that it is applied as part of Community policy , as provided for in Article 174 ( 2 ) of our Treaty and now established as an ongoing precedent by the Court of Justice .
We fully share the view expressed by many of you that students have to be helped , not least because they have been the platform , the basis and the bulk of those who have protested peacefully after the elections , but also because the cementing of democracy will rest very much on their shoulders .
Clearly , paragraph 2 &apos;s stout defence of the Commission &apos;s stance in rejecting renationalisation would differ from my own view , as we have already discussed .
The population has been taken hostage and is being increasingly ill treated - there are rumours of massacres at Jenin and Nablus - and the people are isolated , following the refusal by the Israeli army to authorise the presence of witnesses , journalists or internationalists .
Secondly , in view of the twin threat that we are now facing , namely the public health problem generated by the prevalence of obesity among our young people and the social problem that is typified by an education system based on personalised choice , the European Union and the twenty-seven Member States have to react and rethink the relationship between sport and education .
I gather , from the round of applause , that this is what the House would like , in which case the House needs to change the Rules , because they do not permit me to do this .
However , in relation to the school milk scheme , which is vital , can I just give you the views of Áine - who happens to be one of my own and who is aged ten .
In light of the review of the Lisbon objectives and the evaluation of the roadmap , will the European Commission propose specific measures to combat the lack of women in positions of responsibility in the labour market .
Let me stress that several Member States currently use the possibility to couple part of the direct aid to environment objectives to support protein crops .
We are not even giving ourselves the instruments to respond to this need for Europe , this appeal to Europe , this demand for Europe - that is so strong in so many parts of the world , from the near east to the southern shores of the Mediterranean - to this need for European values , to be a partner in essentially fairer development which is based more on human , civil and political rights .
I support the principles behind Amendment 17 and can accept paragraphs 1 and 2 of that amendment , with modifications committing the Council , as well as the Commission , and making reference to maintaining the arrangements embodied in Annex IVb of Regulation ( EC ) No 27 / 2005 on a comparable basis to the cod recovery plan .
. The ability of Member States in the European Union to decide their own policy on requiring visas for travel to those states and to change it , as and when required , for security or other reasons would be adversely affected by this measure .
Madam President , in the internal market the consumer is free to obtain products and services from other Member States , and he sees this as one of the biggest advantages of that internal market .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , we are now at the decisive moment of what has been , in my opinion , a good exercise in democracy .
The continuous decrease in import duties is supposed to promote economic prosperity .
Belarus is not only a near neighbour of the Union , involved in the European Neighbourhood Policy , but it is also an immediate neighbour of my country , Poland .
However , the deployment of observers on site can only take place when Colombia and the United Nations have signed the convention governing the rules and terms of reference of this office .
The Europe 2020 strategy , the recognised successor of the so-called Lisbon Strategy , must start by making an appropriate assessment of the methods of its predecessor .
The United States of America might have been expected to take on the task over the last few months , but it has proved quite incapable of doing so .
Finally , I believe that we should remain vigilant regarding the issue of renewing the cars on the road in the Union .
The third point concerns the new Member States , in regard to which this is a historic budget .
For years , the Council has approved faulty accounts and so disqualified itself from finding the right candidate .
The increasing cultivation of biofuel crops , financial speculation , producers switching very rapidly to more profitable crops and , last but not least , the change in the eating habits of citizens in many states , are also new topics closely related to the subject of today &apos;s report .
We are , of course , monitoring the work being carried out in this respect by the Convention on the future of Europe , which may well open up new prospects ; we hope it does .
It is not only the farmers who are affected ; it has an impact on everyone in these rural areas , including tourism and thousands of jobs .
Existing diseases are not fully understood , and problems such as colony collapse disorder are as yet unexplained and unresolved .
The importance of protecting and managing the resource base of economic and social development was reaffirmed by Heads of State and Government at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in September 2002 .
The various political groupings in this House may not fully agree on how exactly to do this or how far to go in this regard , but we are in reasonable agreement on the broad lines .
This means that we cannot accept amendments which introduce either non-defined technical concepts which aim at extending the registration procedure beyond requirements defining this simplified procedure , or which are contrary to the harmonisation sought .
Hardly any treaty agreement , and it says so in the papers , has been ratified by the Member States ; this includes the anti-fraud agreements , the Europol agreement , etc . May I put it this way to Commissioner Gradin : the European Commission is economical with its right legislative initiative .
We have therefore also decided on special requirements , especially for heavy industry , that are not particularly easy to comply with and that are very much open to further discussion .
As a member of Parliament &apos;s Electoral Observer Commission , I agree with colleagues that we have a crucial role to play to ensure that the commitments made by the Palestinian Authority at the London conference on security , democratic reform and good governance are realised .
Staffing decisions must be made more transparent , and the awarding of contracts must be beyond reproach .
The EU must increase its commitments to help the situation of children in Europe and the whole world , so that it can properly ensure the promotion of children &apos;s rights and their protection .
It is translated in different ways in different languages .
First of all , our thanks and recognition are due to the European Parliament .
Madam President , there is no doubt that aviation safety is a vitally important issue and one that we cannot afford to ignore .
The new technologies will one day become as natural as safety belts and radios are today .
Ultimately , economic policies must gain more legitimacy through greater intervention by Parliament under the codecision process .
Our Committee has worked very quickly and efficiently and , on 28 October 1998 , it unanimously adopted the de Coene report with 61 amendments .
I congratulate the Agency on its work , despite insufficient resources , and I hope that these will significantly increase in the future .
We must work to ensure the protection of non-combatants as well as of humanitarian aid workers .
There has to be a common European definition of the crime and vigorous cross-border cooperation to ensure that those who perpetrate it are caught and are punished .
. Mr President , honourable Members , ladies and gentlemen , the ever-increasing speed at which technology advances and the increasing pressure of competition on global markets are compelling car manufacturers to adapt their production methods and also their business structures to changed conditions .
Whilst we must ensure that the birth rate goes up , it is not up to us politicians , but parents , to ensure children get born .
However the committee felt that in the first instance there is little point in Parliament &apos;s vote on this report since it comes after the agreement has been signed .
My group strongly endorses what Mrs in &apos;t Veld is proposing , particularly the need to change to a &quot; push &quot; system for an agreement in the short term , and the need to avoid the direct transfer of data to the judicial authorities for an agreement in the medium term .
I now want to ask you two questions .
I think that this regulation and this legal basis will , with the measures that follow , help to improve food safety in the European Union , and will establish the general principles of the new food law .
Mr President , on behalf of the ELDR Group I would like to congratulate the Commission , and Commissioner Bolkestein in particular , on his efforts to try to reach agreement with the United States on such a difficult matter .
Therefore , I would like to thank Mr Mitchell for his good work .
Indeed , we must not lose sight of the guiding principle that underpins the introduction of this initiative : bringing citizens closer to the institutions , stimulating their interest in Europe , promoting their involvement , and making them stakeholders of European policies .
The issue of peaceful co-existence in the area relies on respect for territorial integrity and on the inviolability of frontiers , and is an essential prerequisite for partnership relations to develop between the European Union and the countries of the South .
Our , or my proposal is that the Commission should present a report in a few years &apos; time and report to Parliament on whether or not the principles of free , transparent competition have been contradicted and then we can take another decision .
I welcome what he said about talking to Mrs Wallström .
In the rush to do our Christmas shopping we do not always stop to think about the safety standards of toys purchased for our youngest friends and relatives .
In the committee debate we were able to improve the proposal , although , in the opinion of our group , the end result is still not acceptable .
The rapporteur also has my support in calling for public / private investment to obtain a modern transport and communications infrastructure in the Union and I support his call to the Commission and the Council to find the appropriate financing mechanism - such as an expanded role for the EIB .
That is why it is not proposed to do away with cohesion policy outright , but to radically refocus it , due to alleged waste of Structural Funds and abuses in the area .
Unfortunately , when it happens , as a result , that some questions are included in a question time period and are not dealt with , this depends , unfortunately , not on the President , but on a matter of chance which I can do nothing to remedy .
The Committee on Petitions cooperates well with the relevant departments within the European Commission and with the European Ombudsman , and also with the appropriate representatives of the Member States and regional and local authorities , in providing appropriate explanations .
So , Mr Evans rightly referred to the need for fair treatment , for a bilateral but not unbalanced approach : if we are behaving ourselves , the others should behave as well .
Mr President , I would mainly like to speak about Mr Hendrick &apos;s report , which concerns the powers of the European Central Bank to collect statistical information .
Consequently , the only course of action open to me at the moment is to try and persuade Parliament and the Council to reach an agreement .
In addition , the development of ports and airports in Romania and the implementation of cross-border transport projects at the border between Romania , Moldova and Ukraine need to feature again among the priority TEN-T projects .
Let me repeat : a nuclear-powered plant to produce energy - you may like it or not , but that is not the issue being debated today - requires , as you know , at least seven or eight years from the moment the contract is signed to the moment the power plant is operational .
I hope the Commission will take these points seriously .
Some 450 new national technical rules are introduced annually .
I also appeal to industry to do their part in helping us with the public relations work so that acceptance will increase .
The Commission is aware that the political situation is due to the lack of democratic reforms and extensive human rights violations , like arrests and detentions without charge .
We would very much like to see a place on the agenda to discuss the nuclear power plant at Temelin , as in many Member States , especially in Austria , obviously , as it is next door to it , the situation is very tense .
The process of improving border security and management has a strong component of regional cooperation , and so the European Union is currently working closely with NATO and the OSCE to support the efforts which the countries in the region have started to make themselves .
The question as to how to choose between cohesion or competitiveness , equality or efficiency has recently arisen .
Consequently , measures to reduce tobacco production will do nothing to reduce consumption ; they will merely boost imports .
What is crucial is whether a country can be trusted as being willing and able to meet its commitments in time and engaging in serious structural reforms .
I am not surprised at that - I know Anita Gradin very well - but until I have formal confirmation I cannot release the letter .
Mr Colom I Naval has done excellent work in drafting his report and , in it , explaining the difficulties associated with the use of resources from the Structural Funds .
It has been recognised that our point of view is correct .
The Prestige accident has already been mentioned by many people .
The rapporteur supports the Commission proposal and asks the Council to consult Parliament again if it intends to depart from that proposal .
If ten countries actually are added in 2004 , the EUR 3 billion left over would be for two countries , Bulgaria and Romania .
We in the western world - both Europe and the USA - therefore have a duty to do our utmost to secure peace and stability , which will be difficult enough .
No matter how important the position may be , I really cannot see that an ombudsman , who is to monitor this data , should , in salary terms , be on the same footing as a judge at the European Court of Justice .
Maritime pollution , climate change , shipping and coastal developments continue to threaten the marine environment and to have an adverse impact on human health .
Mr President , this resolution on Chechnya is the most far-reaching there has ever been at international level and that is a credit to this House , for in the first war too , we contributed decisively to a peace agreement being signed .
In conclusion , we would stress the essential value of maintaining , at Community level , a strong programme of action in favour of economic and social cohesion .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to begin by congratulating the Spanish Presidency and , in particular , Mr Piqué on all their efforts to bring the Valencia Conference , whose results I do not underestimate , to a successful conclusion .
In order to do this , however , I must address the issue that the rapporteur raised on the legal base of the programme .
These exports are now up and running again and we have recreated thousands of jobs on a sustainable basis .
Despite this , I recommend caution in view of the hidden costs which will arise for the Member States .
One of the fields in which I think we as European leaders can give a mission to a European institute of technology is that of energy and climate change .
Mr Santer will recall his appearance before the committee and the series of exchanges that we had with him concerning Parliament &apos;s supposed denial of funds for research .
I agree with the opinion that vaccination strategies should rely on three conditions to be successful : efficacy of the vaccine , a positive benefit-risk balance for the vaccine , and targeting of risk groups .
I therefore welcome Mrs Niebler &apos;s initiative and stress the importance of continuity and constancy in the diplomatic relations between the EU and Russia in order to ensure that the international geopolitical balance is maintained .
This shows that it is high time for us to rethink the method of authorisation of GMOs in the European Union .
Its significance is not merely economic ; it will have a direct effect on the deepening of transatlantic relations .
They farm , not just for a living , but in order to live , and this makes a difference .
Madam President , I went to Genoa at the invitation of the Genoa Social Forum and I was surprised because I had never seen such police conduct , and I say that having fought for democracy and freedom in Spain since 1966 .
Mr President , I should like first of all to compliment the rapporteur , Mrs Colombo Svevo , on her comprehensive report , to which there is really nothing to add . It touches on all the relevant points and draws attention to the potential of this sector , underscoring the need for regulation and intervention , and highlighting the role that the European Union and Member States can play in boosting a sector which is without doubt important for women &apos;s employment .
I thought the whole emphasis of the European Union was to settle disputes with the Commission and the Member States .
The enlargement process must not be delayed by a stipulation on the part of the European Parliament that the distribution of mandates and weighting of votes should be in place before the first countries can be accepted .
The fall in the prices of milk and dairy products primarily affects farms with low incomes .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner , the intention behind EMAS is an excellent one : encouraging companies to have more respect for the environment .
These are the two necessary conditions for democracy to function .
We in the European Parliament are all working for a free and democratic Moldova .
Despite some of the very serious issues that have been raised here this evening , we did not hold the workers hostage and we approved the EUR 14.8 million application .
Mr Blokland pointed this out and I share his view on this .
We can then try to adopt a resolution in December .
It was already clear at the weekend that the situation was turning into something very exceptional , and over the weekend , we had several discussions on how to approach the issue .
However , we hope that the results of this programme will be sufficiently convincing for Member States to take future action to provide a decent budget for the Raphael programme .
The reference to marine biological resource conservation must be removed from the list of exclusive competences .
If we miss this moment , it will be lost for a generation and the cause of reform will be lost with it .
The report lists such possible measures , and I shall not repeat them .
It cannot be done by July . But because we want to answer Parliament &apos;s concern , we will have to find a feasible solution here , for example on the basis of a sample .
The Group of the Greens has also requested that on Wednesday the Council and Commission statement on the health workers detained in Libya be replaced by a Council and Commission statement on the patentability of computer software .
I invite everyone to carefully consider this .
However , today we have a result that we can be proud of and that is constructive and discriminating , because the matter is complicated and there is no simple answer to it .
This leads me to believe that this is the right way to go , as these machines are marketed around the world : several stages to reduce nitrogen oxides and particulates , with the result that , at the final stage , the incorporation of a particulate filter is an invariable requirement , enabling the substantial risk to health to be contained and the public , especially in urban agglomerations to be protected .
In any outcome of the EPA negotiations , the implementation of obligations of ACP partners will be phased in over a very long period and this will facilitate adjustment and identify requirements that we need to help meet .
As has been pointed out , to a certain extent women experience different health problems from men .
We will have to continue patiently to seek forms of regular communication , at least between the Council and Parliament .
The European Councils in Tampere , Laeken and Seville have represented a significant advance in the field of immigration .
Climate change will not stop as the economy slows , and the poorest countries will suffer - still - from our carbon consumption .
Let me remind you of our experience with the Auto-Oil programme for cars .
It is in fact an agreement with the USA and with any other countries to which the USA unilaterally decides to transfer personal data on European passengers .
Not all Member States are adhering to the requirements of the directive .
In the area of research , we know that the number of people suffering this disease doubles every 20 years .
The current system of own resources has a number of shortcomings .
. We wish to express our unequivocal criticism of the appalling and irresponsible remarks about Israel made by the President of Iran .
The EU should take much better care of taxpayers &apos; money .
Especially excellent , by the way , because it contains two issues which could provide a correction to the decisions made last time on the report to the summit on employment .
The internalisation of external costs - and I have listened closely to the rapporteur &apos;s words - is not a regular tax .
In the Netherlands , which wanted to take the lead , liberalisation has resulted in a significant reduction in the quality of train services .
. Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats is not entirely dissatisfied with the state of affairs in respect of the services directive .
I therefore voted to abstain on this resolution .
I believe that it is by applying clear , fair and precise standards that we will not only ensure that refugees are protected but also fight to release them from the grasp of criminal organisations .
It is necessary to have rules governing such action , and that was why I used the phrase &apos; no trading without tracking &apos; .
Commissioner , you are on the right track .
I really do not believe that we need to harmonise the differing systems .
However , the Commission agrees on the general aim fully to close the gap between long-term objectives and current ozone levels and could accept Amendments Nos 2 and 6 .
Let us find ways of understanding each other , cooperating , respecting each other &apos;s competences , facilitating our respective work .
We trust that proper administration of the obligations and rights of this institution by the European Ombudsman over coming years will promote sound administration in the institutions of the European Union even more effectively and will foster an even more citizen-friendly attitude on the part of its institutions .
No one has the right to make a mockery of the memory of those who have perished in wars .
If I were in charge of an industrial plant , my job would be to find a favourable course of action to take .
. I shall resist the very considerable opportunity that has been presented to me to discuss the inconsistencies inherent in UKIP &apos;s position and simply say that I fully recognise , not least on the basis of the tireless work in Scotland of the honourable lady who asked the question , that fisheries partnership agreements can have a very important role to play .
We need only think of two fundamental issues , such as enlargement and monetary union .
( Applause ) And it is for that reason that I personally believe it is important and an enormous step forward that the regions with legislative powers can be represented .
I consider that Mr Diamandouros has been efficient and consistent and has worked to promote transparency and to address issues relating to a lack thereof .
We should not forget that regional policy is still an essential component in moving towards the Europe of citizens .
I would also like to stress that the Barcelona criteria do not involve forcing a single solution on anyone but providing a real choice , a real choice for parents because , ladies and gentlemen , the fundamental point has been made in the debate and in my opinion very clearly in the last contribution , that genuinely attentive and loving parents naturally have a great ability to distinguish how to decide at a given moment , in a given phase of family life , or in a given situation , what will be best for their children .
For this reason , the FDP in the European Parliament abstained from voting .
In ports , is it the wind destroying fishing craft , fishermen &apos;s livelihoods , small businesses and shipyards ?
As for the honourable Member who has now left , Mr President , I shall get up and leave in the middle of one of the next sittings to bring home to the honourable Members of Parliament how idiotic it is , not to mention discourteous to the Commission , for anyone here to comment on the chocolate issue and then simply to go away before the Commissioner can deal with the point that has been raised .
Paradoxically , the Kurdish flow has now stopped , as this is one of the few remaining peaceful areas of the country .
( PL ) Mr President , Prime Minister , you referred to the European Union as a global player , especially once the Treaty has been ratified .
A happy outcome is worth waiting for , and our group , the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , thanks Mrs Sommer , the rapporteur , for the valuable work she has done .
We also want terms in contracts to be simple , familiar , comprehensible and comparable and for this to be compulsory so that customers really can change suppliers .
On a final note , I should like to say to Romania that we are strict where the criteria are concerned .
These standards are supposed to be transposed and adapted to the EU legal framework through a revision of the Capital Requirements Directive ( CRD ) .
It is a chance to speak to European citizens about a topic they can easily relate to , especially with the June elections to the European Parliament looming .
Eventual military action against Iraq would further worsen the living conditions of the Iraqi people , and in particular of those of the most vulnerable civilian population groups .
That is why we need to sort out the smaller ones .
Many members of the public would have liked to see him - perhaps in another position - as an interpreter , even though not all of them share his views .
Merely in terms of medical expenses it costs between 200 and 600 billion euros per annum .
It has to come in connection with and after the discussion we are having now on reviewing the Financial Regulation and the implementing rules .
Competence means power , and the creation of an area of freedom , security and justice is paving the way for an appalling form of centrist EU control .
. Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , with regard to human rights , I would like to take the opportunity to mention a .
No doubt the local and decentralized use of renewable energies will , together with the liberalization of the energy market , enable the existing imbalances between some European regions to be made good and to quickly favour the development of those regions in arrears , providing them with independent energy capacity for multiple use .
We need openness ; we need transparency .
That is why the third pillar was added within the context of the Maastricht Treaty .
My own country , Denmark , is among the worst .
Within the EU , renewable sources currently account for 6 % of total energy consumption .
( RO ) Mr President , as I also observed during the European Parliament delegation &apos;s official visit last year , of which I was a member , Iceland has made huge investments in education and research and development .
That will help the Commission to bypass some of the resistance expressed by some Member States as far as this initiative is concerned .
They never mention &apos; preference &apos; , except when it comes to encouraging an even greater liberalisation of our markets .
( PL ) Madam President , with today &apos;s vote , we have brought to an end the lengthy process of over three years &apos; work on the draft of a Directive on Consumer Rights .
We are also in favour of having a clear obligation for the provision of information and in favour of recipient countries &apos; being approved in the case of exports to third countries .
We in the Verts / ALE Group shall continue to fight for these .
I can tell Mrs Auroi and Mrs Boudjenah that we debated GATS only a few weeks ago .
Article 138a of the Maastricht Treaty is more or less a dead letter .
Finally , Mr President , as well as our group &apos;s belief in the importance of the step forward in terms of European defence , in relation to external relations I would like to say that my group welcomes and supports the decision of this Parliament &apos;s Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy to award the Sakharov Prize to Kofi Annan , to the United Nations staff who have died and also in memory of Sergio Vieira de Mello .
Thus , whilst eliminating distortions in competition and combating social dumping - and I would like to have the opinion of the Council and the Commission on the precise measures which are being envisaged in this area - it is also necessary at European level to commit substantial sums of money to encourage investment , research and development , training and equipment modernization .
It is therefore a question of finding a balance between efficiency and democracy .
Then we would carry out a wide-ranging debate only once the Commission had formally presented its proposal .
Thank you for those statements .
So please consider timetabling this earlier to give us the possibility of participating , as we did previously .
Community policies have presented many challenges to the outermost regions .
Regarding lifting the secrecy classification for access to files , I have already explained that the Commission has not resorted to this in any of the twenty requests for access submitted by the Ombudsman .
Mr President , we hoped that , after the Berlin Wall came down , certain limits could be placed upon the atrocities committed in the world .
Indeed , since 1992 , 100.000 jobs have been lost every year .
on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - ( PT ) Mr President , the title of the Commission communication and of the Commission &apos;s proposal for a Council regulation is enough to confirm , if there were any doubts , that the measures proposed do not aim to deal with the causes of the current exacerbation of the socioeconomic situation in the fisheries sector .
The Europe which has no foreign policy , but is led back and forth by the Americans ?
We have therefore expressed our satisfaction concerning the legislative elections held on 5 June , whilst noting the statement by joint international mission of observers regarding certain significant shortcomings .
Both the delegation which , as Mr García Margallo said , visited Cuba and El Salvador , and the previous delegation that went to Honduras and Nicaragua , were able to see first hand the situation in which these countries find themselves , which , it must be said , is gloomy .
There are 110 different types of driving licence in the European Union today .
In short , these regions &apos; best chance of affirming their cultural identity is through a process of cultural renewal .
Nuclear weapons are a problem in both Iran and North Korea , but this new cold war being waged between Russia and the United States , in which we are participating , is a bigger problem .
Commissioner , as well as technology and geography , you must also ensure that the safety culture and the structure of safety policies are included in the stress test when the proposal is put forward .
They need to be able to take all the current problems of the new economy into account .
As a result of this compromise , from 1 January 1999 the Commission will have at its disposal , thanks to the European Parliament &apos;s help , a much more flexible and pragmatic method of maintaining the European Union &apos;s support for the Palestinian people and the peace process .
They are coming under even more pressure from the multinationals .
These various measures , which are necessary , will improve the situation of the victims of road accidents throughout the European Union .
Those of us who have serious concerns about the lack of access , the difficulty of doing work , the need to transport all our files , our staff , the committee staff , Parliament staff , the group staff , to Strasbourg for four days 12 times a year believe it can no longer be justified given the enormous expense .
Firstly , it was decided a few years ago , in the wake of the arms initiative , that as from 2009 everything except arms may be supplied to Europe from the poorest countries .
In another Commission report of 18 June , just a couple a weeks ago , regarding the directive on preparations and the directive on means of controlling harmful organisms in plants it was stated that the four-year transitional period will in all likelihood be insufficient .
They should be able to register their product for simple and cost-effective evaluation .
When I visited Lithuania in September , that date had not been decided upon .
I should like to pose the question as to what economic freedom and freedom of competition within the European Union actually mean .
So , in other words , it offers a great many opportunities , but we should also set conditions , of course .
What is more , the issues that were being disputed had already been resolved in the Convention , including the scope of the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
. Mr President , that is enough talk : let us act .
There were many reasons for the no-vote .
We all know that the Saharoui people are supposed to vote in a referendum very soon on self-determination but of course many serious problems have been posed by the Moroccans .
Membership talks with Cyprus begin six months after the government conference : at the beginning of next year , therefore .
We need to make progress .
There must be no walls of silence where murder is committed .
The heated debate preceding this directive is astonishing .
On this point , I would recommend to the Council that they should just think a bit about whether they can refer back to what the ECJ decided when they ruled on the subject in 1998 .
We disagree with that view , which in effect exempts employers from any contribution towards dealing with the crisis .
As a staunch European , I must therefore vote against this report .
There are good proposals for this in the Convention , that go a little further than what the Commission has proposed .
Madam President , firstly I would like to reassure President Prodi .
However , Africa still remains the poorest continent on our planet , where people have the shortest life expectancy in the world , where there is famine and disease on an unprecedented scale , while the level of education and health , especially in poor urban areas and villages , is almost zero .
They can be both voluntary and mandatory .
It is the attainment of these objectives that needs redoubled efforts in the years to come .
Obviously the Commission has a major role to play in the application of European law as the guarantor of application of the Treaties , but it must do this in conjunction with the legislative bodies , and it certainly cannot replace the legislative powers conferred by the Treaties on Parliament and the Council .
Fourthly , because most of the new countries still have a very large agricultural sector in comparison to the current European Union .
Unfortunately , modern tourism is very much like visiting a Europe-wide chain of supermarkets that all subscribe to the same principles , namely to be cheap , easily accessible and preferably identical in the majority of cases .
The deployment of European Union funds for repairs to these pipelines would certainly bring environmental benefit .
At the beginning of next year , the Commission will present a communication on how the European Union is to be able to contribute globally to sustainable development .
So much for the first chapter of the amendments by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs .
I think this is an outrage .
It democratises the European Union , among other things by reinforcing the legislative role of our Parliament .
I hope this will be one of our successes - one of the successes of the European Union within the framework of a reform that is imminent and can be delayed no longer .
A European voluntary service could undoubtedly help to overcome the cultural and social divisions that exist , especially fostering the promotion of tolerance , peace and international solidarity .
The point I wish to put to the President-in-Office , however , concerns Laeken .
We could also use the Structural Funds in conjunction with the European stability mechanism to make deficit countries converge upwards .
I would like to say finally that it is essential that the educational services of museums , theatres , libraries , etc. which are available to the public , are available in more than one official language of the European Union . And if possible in several , so that we can all identify with what we are going to read .
No human being is illegal , and one cannot possibly tell whether or not a human being is in an illegal situation .
We believe that the state has not always acted in the citizens &apos; best interests , but we fear that privatisation will dismantle public services and we intend to fight a digital divide in society .
I urge all Members to sign it .
The government in Yemen and the international community must not just take stop-gap measures , because they are faced with structural problems , and even if we can stop al-Qaeda in Yemen , the problems will return if we do not eliminate the causes .
In conclusion , I would earnestly ask the Commission , on the one hand - I repeat - to ban the importation of genetically modified products and , on the other , to authorize the placing on the market of a certain number of products generated within the European Union with all the necessary guarantees , so as not , finally , to put us in a drastically inferior position compared with third countries .

. This particular proposal can be traced over 20 years and today we should be reaping the benefit of the conclusion of intense negotiations and compromises , not only here in Parliament , but also in the Council and amongst the social partners .

From 1 May 2009 , the remit of the EGF has been expanded and it now includes assistance to workers made redundant as a direct consequence of the economic and financial crisis .

It is a good thing to have big multinationals , banks and insurance companies which operate worldwide producing their annual accounts to a single standard .

draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development . - Madam President , for 2010 we need a budget harnessing effectively all European policies to pull the European economy out of the crisis , while at the same time preserving our long-term objectives and commitments , which are sustainable growth , economic and social cohesion , and our obligations vis-à-vis the external world , including candidate countries .
The observations and comments made by Human Rights Watch merit our attention , especially as this is an independent organisation that does not receive subsidies from any quarter .
Mr President , I must just correct in that case .
The report states how abuse was not investigated in the Commission , or , if it was , it was investigated too late and too long .
Perhaps it would have been better to have a stronger Commission then , in terms of its proposals , just as , in certain exceptional circumstances , the Member States need to feel guided by the Commission leadership .
in writing . - Exploiting children in any way is unacceptable .
Mr President , Madam President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like first of all to say on behalf of the Socialist Group that we support , and are going to vote in favour of , the report jointly produced by Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Seguro , which has been produced seriously and elegantly and in a spirit of not only Iberian but also European cooperation .
I am also clear about the fact that we should not use Turkmenistan and the Interim Agreement as a hostage in order to shift the balance of power between the European institutions .
This is very positive and it gives a stable framework for our external relations until 2013 .
For example , the 2007-2013 regulations can become more flexible .
To seek to try and make a competence for the EU for such an endeavour merely because there was funding prior to 1992 - which has now ceased - is impossible to achieve .

President Barroso , Commissioner Verheugen , I think we should really learn something from the sad story of Italy &apos;s economy and its Government , which came to power promising a new economic miracle by cutting taxes and environmental rules , and today the country is bottom of the table for growth and competitiveness in Europe .
I have spoken directly to the competent ministers in a number of Member States about this , with the result that licences for slaughter plants have been suspended in two particular Member States for a period of time .

Mr President-in-Office of the Council , you have mentioned some important meetings and work in progress .
There is no statistical data on this very specific subject , because we have to work with figures that are very difficult to obtain , given that we are talking about illegal immigration on the one hand and about illegal employment on the other , but it seems to us at first sight that this number is rather high .
Mr Hänsch , I was also surprised that the amendment I tabled in the matter to the report on the Czech Republic was supported by the European People &apos; s Party and others in the Committee on Foreign Affairs but was not supported by the majority of the Social Democrats .
Firstly , Detroit highlights the fact that terrorists continue to target civil aviation as a priority .

I , too , now join the call to release all political prisoners immediately and to re-run the elections with a long-term EU observation mission in place and with the OSCE &apos;s full agreement that it meets all the standards required for it to be essentially free and fair .
I do not believe that problems of this type should exist when we have tragic situations to deal with .
He is absolutely right to reject the 10 % across the board crude reduction in development lines .
This is purely a national decision on the basis of subsidiarity and therefore we should not burden Parliament with it .
Mr President , regarding the financial perspectives , the situation is extremely worrying in a lot of areas , especially those of rural development and environmental protection .
Mrs Oomen-Ruijten has the floor , to justify the request .
In view of current events in Germany , I favour the strictest controls right along the food production chain .
All this achieves is a loss of confidence for the consumer and above all else the destruction of the producer .
No one , in 1991 , was aware of the possible consequences of instituting the policy of non-vaccination .
That is too much of a good thing .
The sectoral inquiry will be completed by the end of the year .
It may be that what has been termed the Marshall Plan for Palestine has not received enough attention - although it was certainly discussed at the Council . The population of Palestine has a per capita income of USD 800 per year , whereas the per capita income of the Israeli people is USD 18.000 per year .
I would especially like to thank the Commissioner for making herself available this evening , but also for being available and communicating with us to share information and keep track of this dossier .
The Commission , like this House - and I should thank the rapporteur for his quick work - has put in a great deal of work on this , in a very short time , I may add .
We have launched a consultation and intend to build upon the results of that consultation in a green paper .
in writing . - We voted against this report in accordance with UKIP principles and on the basis that we support legislation only where it limits the power of the EU or returns it to nation states .
If Member States fail to get to grips with their fraud cases , they must also face the threat of having their subsidies cut off or they must be made to pay for the losses to the EU resulting from their authorities &apos; lax controls .
Universities are the cornerstone of our societies , so encouraging universities , students and teachers to forge closer links and share experiences will play a crucial role in enriching our societies .
I should like to see real cooperation being established in order to guarantee , pursuant to this principle , repair of the damage caused .
That is why the SET Plan is so important for Europe .
However , the EU Oil Supply Group met to allow all Member States to review their intended response and give those who are not members of the IEA an opportunity to contribute to that broader discussion .
We think that the electoral process must be improved and monitored by the European institutions and we hope that this most serious incident will not be repeated and will not cast a shadow over the scrutiny envisaged for 1998 , so that the people of Cambodia finally have a chance to cast their vote freely without constraint and with respect for human rights .
- discrimination suffered by tens of millions of honest people who are the victims of insecurity because they do not have the opportunity to live in protected parts of their towns ;
Of course , Britain can manage in the short run outside the euro , but over time , we stand to lose out : our businesses are handicapped in the European market by conversion costs and hedging costs that their competitors in that market do not face ; and inward investors into the European market will prefer to be in the major currency area rather than the smaller one .
The starting point in this whole debate must be that we are representatives of democratic nations .
Nothing happened to the men , but the girl was sentenced for adultery under Sharia law .
An average of EUR 1.000 is required to be paid over three years for unwanted contracts , as Mr Busuttil has already mentioned .
( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the decisive question in relation to all the economic recovery plans which are being put in place throughout Europe is , of course : who will receive the money ?
Mr President , I have just got here only to find that my voting card is missing from the machine .
We started to misread the intentions of Saddam Hussein in early 1990 .
The meeting in Bonn will be a good opportunity to emphasise the importance of the production of biofuels in line with sustainability requirements both within and outside the EU .
That is what is officially recorded ; the true figure may well be many times higher .
If they are then stored in refrigerated warehouses , people are employed there too , and so on .
All in all , this is a package of measures which I hope will find the support of the whole Parliament in the interests of the weakest members of society , in the interests of our children !
On genetically modified organisms I would repeat my earlier statements .
I need to underline that I must be certain that if we undertake commitments , we will be able physically to fulfil them .
This is not difficult to understand .
With regard to the coordination of our budgetary policies , I would say that the system has improved , but that , nevertheless , we cannot be completely satisfied , since we have too many deviations .
What needs to be done in order to break with these policies and make a greater commitment to production , to jobs and to valuing labour ?
In addition the UK Government has already estimated extra costs to the UK sector of £ 50 million , a fact that the Commission is determined to ignore .
We are committed to the safety of the public and to animal welfare .
This report on telecommunications forcefully reasserts the need to improve the European public service at the same time as telecommunications are liberalized in our information society .
As far as sanctions are concerned I should like to stress what was said by Mrs Erika Mann on extra-territoriality .
There are no real indications that such funds are switching from US dollars to euros and , moreover , their order of magnitude is not yet on a level that would enable them to have a significant effect on developments in the international money markets .
However , our objectives and our ambitions remain unchanged : creating genuine new business opportunities in agricultural and industrial products and services in developed and advanced developing countries , as well as contributing to development ; restructuring trade in agriculture ; and strengthening multilateral rules .
Over recent years the situation in this sector has gone from bad to worse ; we are witnessing social dumping of epic proportions , above all in the case of long-distance lorry drivers , not to mention coach drivers .
. First of all , I apologise for appearing in front of the House for yet another farewell appearance .
An Arab League delegation is due to visit the region with a clear message for Saddam Hussein within the next few days .
In this Chamber too , voices in favour of legalising and liberalising drugs and classifying them as dangerous and less dangerous are being heard more and more often .
A series of rights provided for passengers on short-distance regular services has also been established , in particular , non-discriminatory access to transport and the right to information while travelling .
We are also opposed to the Commission &apos;s and the Member States &quot; having to emphasise the need for climate protection by engaging in dialogue with other countries .
We are now a year down the line , but , sadly , not much further down the line metaphorically speaking .
The room for interpretation on the basis of the Lisbon structural reforms - what is known as the &quot; Lisbonisation &quot; of the Pact - is little more than a means of enabling the more powerful countries to make interpretations that suit their interests , and not intrinsically for us to have an Pact .
There are two things that the Social Democrats in the European Parliament always bear in mind : first , the protection of people and the environment , with a sustainable way of doing business , and secondly our enterprises &quot; need for a proper framework and conditions if they are to be able to do business and create jobs for the people whom we - as I said in my first point - want to protect from harm .
I would argue emphatically that fewer coins are easier for the user to manage and the increasing use of electronic payment systems for small amounts will further reduce the number of cash transactions like this .
In future , these businesses will have to be certified , as the only way of obtaining general authorisations .
I would also like to stress that this initiative can , and should , lead to the better use of EU funds , not an increase in expenditure .
Our language is unintelligible and , at times , incomprehensible , and we therefore have to know how to say that this is a problem in itself and a challenge in itself , so that we can move closer to the European people .
Small and medium-sized enterprises therefore serve as banks for public corporations or large businesses .
Parliament &apos;s report is most timely and important for the animal health situation in the European Union .
The external evaluation of the first three years , commissioned by the European Commission , shows that the Foundation concentrated too much on managing programmes and too little on policy advice .
Are they too ambitious , though , and can the Member States , especially the new ones , manage to meet the rigorous requirements ?
Finally , let me say a word about energy policy .
It is important that we reaffirm that the freedom of association and the peaceful operation of trade unions represent a fundamental right under the European Convention of Human Rights .
I wish to extend those congratulations to all the members of the Committee on Women &apos;s Rights and all Members who have contributed to the formulation of the programme and the plan of action to combat violence against women and children .
( PL ) Mr President , this resolution on Georgia is important , and I voted in favour of it , although I feel that the European Union , which was faced with an important test as a result of events in Georgia , failed to pass that test .
The planned activities shall , moreover , be open to the participation of EEA countries and those of Central and Eastern Europe countries subject to arrangements , especially financial arrangements , to be agreed with these countries .
This competence must be carried out as closely to the population as possible , and that means that there will probably never be a need for a general European education system .
Simply reducing a democratic deficit is not sufficient to improve contact with the citizen .
I am aware that sanctions against Iraq and the Iraqi question fall primarily within the competence of the United Nations , but it would have been really useful for the EU to show solidarity in this as well .
It affects the whole of Europe and needs to be dealt with at that level .
In this connection , I would like to support what the rapporteur , Mr Gil-Robles , and the Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , Mr Napolitano , have already said about the problems of the two-tier regime for the composition and functioning of the Commission , which , to my mind , is undesirable because it is inefficient .
Many are endeavouring to restrict future enlargement and believe that a Constitution which has been rejected in a national referendum should be put swiftly into effect .
How can people have so little interest in a market likely to grow so rapidly ?
I am wondering what the outcome of this Council will be . It is supposed to be an opportunity to debate the progress made in the application of asylum and immigration policies , and the consequences of the Arab revolutions , at Europe &apos;s borders .
The end result is that the European Parliament will reinforce its powers , particularly on codecision , and increase its ability to influence decision-making , thus enhancing the democratic legitimacy of the European Union .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , first of all , let me come directly to what I would call the most urgent problem today .
In the end , when he was threatened with being brought before the courts , he had to leave by the back door .
My request is that as set out in the statement adopted during the conciliation procedure , there will be &apos; appropriate involvement of the Parliament in respect of such matters under the CFSP &apos; .
Mr President , Mr Delors , ladies and gentlemen , as I look around , I can spot many well-known and familiar faces here and I am very pleased to see all of you again .
If certain amendments calling for stricter provisions are accepted , then we can kiss biotechnology in the area of plants goodbye and we can totally ban it right away , but that is not what we want to do .
The report also recognises the ongoing efforts of publishers &apos; and journalists &apos; representatives to create a charter of media freedom .
I call on him to press the undoubted case that Israel &apos;s treatment of the Palestinians in the occupied territories is illegal under the fourth Geneva Convention .
But in any case it is an area which manifestly relates to health , to the demographic phenomenon of the ageing of the population , and also to prevention .
This report is right to give your competition policy centre stage , because politicians should not , where specific cases are concerned , step into the shoes of the Commissioner or even the judge .
Community rules expressly provide for excise duties to be charged in accordance with procedure in the Member State concerned .
The European grouping , the European continent , or at least the Union , is the first global organisation to establish a system of clearly calculated objectives , methods of application and capacity to evaluate , year after year , sector after sector , directive after directive , the reality of the changes taking place in accordance with our directives , in other words under the supervision of the Commission on the one hand and the Court of Justice on the other hand .
More importantly perhaps , in Amendment No 23 , the word &apos; établis &apos; has been translated as &apos; residentes &apos; ; and I would point out - though not as emphatically , since I do not know English as well as I know Spanish - that it has also been translated as &apos; resident &apos; in the English version . With regard to the profession of lawyer , these are different concepts , I believe .
Recovery of cod stocks in the Irish Sea
Finally , but no less importantly , I would like to refer to the rapporteur &apos; s proposal that , in future , this type of report should also include , amongst other issues , an analysis of the way cohesion is developing between the regions within each State .
But it must be set up and it must be deployed because , if it is not , it will be too late .
It is clear that , if there is a need for greater production on the market , there is a need for investment in agriculture . However , for farmers to be able to invest , they need , above all else , stable incomes to give them the courage to take this step .
One huge obstacle to the country &apos;s development are the anti-personnel mines which are a threat to the life and health of people .
This reasoning is flawed , however , as the ETS not only allows exceptions for coal-fired power stations but also permits the energy-intensive industry to be compensated for increased electricity costs .
Critics of nuclear development have always pointed out the financial risks .
They do not guarantee the stability of the markets in exceptional situations in the long term .
In order to deal with these problems , my report recommends two approaches : one is to explore in depth the opportunities offered by the existing Treaties , in particular through the interinstitutional agreement already proposed by the European Parliament , and the other is to reform the Treaties , now that the successful introduction of the euro has eliminated the risk that starting the review process might jeopardise EMU itself - the famous &apos; Pandora &apos;s box &apos; theory .
The consequence will be secondary migration and abuse .
If , one day , citizens are compensated by airlines for their delays , we will have gained a lot of credibility .
Firstly , it is not a question of if we enlarge , it is a question of when we enlarge .
I think it is the wrong signal to send to our new friends and colleagues from Eastern and Central Europe .
Otherwise , there is a cynical attempt to resolve the problems of climate change while simultaneously unleashing and ignoring other problems that will jeopardise their survival .
We have a specific request from the UNHCR that it not be mentioned in the resolution .
I very much regret that France continues to maintain its ban on beef from the UK and , as I have made very clear in previous debates here , I expect the European Commission to urgently proceed with enforcement action .
rapporteur . - Madam President , I would like to refer this report back to committee under Rule 168 ( 2 ) .
I voted for it .
The Commission , the Council and ourselves have had rigorous budgets for the last few years . This will be no exception .
Given the major advances in the scientific and technical fields which have led to the appearance of new methods of diagnosis and treatment , and given that we know the benefits and dangers of the use of ionizing radiation , it has become imperative that the European Community , within the scope of the powers attributed to it by the Treaty on European Union , namely Article 129 , should legislate in order to update Directive 84 / 466 / Euratom .
It is not for the majority in Parliament to correct the election results by forcing the entire electorate to contribute to the financing of five supranational EU parties .
Mr President , the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is the most lethal since the Second World War .
Regarding the latter issue , however , I would like to report here and deeply regret the fact that , on many occasions , the victims are despised and even criminalised ; and their families are persecuted and even accused of harming the good image of a city or country simply because they want to raise awareness of the problem and because they want to demand , and do demand , justice .
On 3 and 4 August , tripartite talks were held in New York between the UN Secretary-General and the foreign ministers of Indonesia and Portugal . The European Union noted the results with satisfaction .
I have now sat in this Parliament for two years .
It is not a good strategy to portray those who disagree with you as selling out or as being puppets .
It can do it again if the Commission , Council and Member States stop turning a blind eye .
( FR ) Mr President , I would first of all like to thank our two rapporteurs for the excellent work that they have done , and then hope that , under the French Presidency , this very important road package will obviously have a future and come to a conclusion .
Every system creates its own type of failures .
Unfortunately , many species died out due to the ravages of civilisation before we had a chance to discover them .
In fact , the Commission should vigorously pursue the liberalisation of the drinking milk market , because the existing system of milk quotas is both antiquated and functionless .
Finally , whereas one of these languages is particularly important in Europe , the other two are used worldwide .
On an annual basis , it represents an increase of 35 % compared to the 9th European Development Fund .
Funding to improve people &apos;s access to basic health and education must be ring-fenced by including a clear benchmark .
( DE ) Mr President , Mr Andor , Mrs Vassiliou , it is true that combating unemployment and the goal of full employment together represent one of our most urgent tasks .
I would also like to say a word about a group called Youth with a Mission . My wife was a missionary for this group before I came here .
This is why the rapporteur , rather than analysing the current economic situation , insists on placing more emphasis on the strictness of the Stability Pact , particularly by increasing the Commission &apos;s autonomy in monitoring the Member States .
We had granted an extension to the import ban for all birds up to 31 May 2006 ; we granted a new extension up to 31 December 2006 and , due to developments in the issue of the spread of bird &apos; flu , there will most probably be a new extension .
In addition , the Council met Parliament half-way and deleted certain exceptions , especially for certain plants which are fired with solid fuels and native brown coal .
For me , cutting bureaucracy does not mean the creation of new reporting obligations and complicated procedures but rather , above all , the avoidance of duplicated regulation and unnecessary burdens .
Both of these programmes have met with a very big response .
It is this tension that we always need to be clear about .
The peoples are separated by a barrier , which may not stop avian flu but may stop people going from one place to the other .
This has nothing to do with the merits of those specifically involved at the moment ; it is a question of structure .
I therefore call on the competent national and European institutions to put in place as quickly as possible a joint humanitarian assistance service , as we requested in the resolution on Haiti .
Mr Rocard &apos;s amendments , and those put forward by the other groups in this House go well beyond what is intended .
The highest standards of energy efficiency and thermo-insulation must apply not only to new buildings but also to renovated building stock .
Furthermore , his explanation of how industry could receive energy tax relief is extremely clear .
Since March 1997 , beef farmers in my constituency in Northern Ireland have watched their business being destroyed by the effects of BSE .
It would be nice if , at least occasionally , we were to honour the legal principle of audiatur et altera pars , instead of blaming everything on the Croats , which is what always happens here .
We are joined in this request by politicians from parties in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland , including colleagues from the Irish Labour Party who have visited Mr Kelly on numerous occasions .
In particular , we regard as most important the call on the Commission to draw up a special report on the human rights situation in the 12 non-EU signatory states and the proposal on the establishment of a European civil peace corps in order to strengthen humanitarian action , achieve a peaceful resolution of conflicts , prevent the outbreak of new conflicts and provide the requisite confidence-building measures .
I am stressing that point in particular because it has been touched upon in many of the speeches we have heard .
Mr President , Council meetings in the last few months have probably had the most important agendas for several years , dealing with three areas in fisheries management : first , the size of the EU fishing fleet under the MAGP ; the new regulations for technical measures proposed by the Commission ; and satellite transponders , an important aspect of the overall control programme .
This means that the measures adopted as part of our policies on trade , agriculture , fisheries and immigration , for example , have to take special account of any repercussions there may be for development in the countries of the South and in Africa in particular .
Even Members of this Parliament have not seen a consolidated text , let alone citizens of the Member States .
Under Article K.1 of the Treaty on European Union , as amended by the Treaty of Amsterdam , the prevention and suppression of racism and xenophobia fall within the competence of the EU .
The European Parliament will of course , as procedures provide , be formally consulted on this revised agreement before its final ratification .
Firstly , the action plan will be designed in accordance with the key principles of the European Union forestry strategy .
In detail , the trialogue agreed to allow the language teachers to continue working under contracts of indefinite duration without having to participate in the call for tender .
If we are going to insist on retrospective labelling , how will they be able to compete ?
My Party sought to cite the Scottish Secretary &apos;s name in the Censure Motion against Mr Hogg in Westminster this week .
I am sorry to have to say this , but I do believe that the House is extremely ill-advised if a majority in it can vote to accept these false promises .
It is his first report , it is a big report and he has done an excellent job in raising all the key issues .
The report itself rightly says that we do not want a European penal code .
More than a billion people have to get by on less than one euro a day .
On the one hand , the World Social Forum was an enormous success this year - 155 000 participants , 135 countries ; that is considerable - and it has taken on a new tone since , on a certain number of issues - social , environmental , economic , financial - many networks have continued to be put in place and have done extremely serious work , in an extremely concrete manner , in order , specifically , to produce a number of proposals which have yet to be developed , but which are very real .
It is confined simply to the mutual recognition of decisions already taken .
It is unacceptable that a network should be maintained for the gathering and processing , in a secret and completely unmonitored way , of potentially any type of information , specifically political , economic and military , which clearly breaches the fundamental right to respect for privacy , enshrined in Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union , which demonstrates the need to completely dismantle this global telecommunications interception network .
&apos; My clear stand is that the European Union should only step in with legislation where there is an obvious need for such regulation and , in such cases , only to the necessary extent .
I would like to repeat what Professor Monti said yesterday during the first Single Market Forum .
Has the Commission considered that and will the Commission consider it ?
I believe our proposal reflects the current state of technology and that it is justifiable , because this Directive has been under discussion for an eternity , and the deadline for these vehicles has actually been exceeded already .
By way of conclusion , I should therefore like to propose that both the Commission and the European Parliament take initiatives for such a far-reaching discussion .
Billions have been spent on helping regimes that have done nothing to ensure the development of the population , and this was done in order to have a clear conscience .
I should also like , in my turn , to ask you a question : do you think that this European superstate really is what our peoples want ?
Employers should be encouraged to arrange education and training for their employees . Incentives to enable low skilled workers to participate in learning programmes are recommendable .
A few days later , the European Council in Nice defined the Commission obligation more precisely and called for a detailed analysis of supply and demand for oleaginous and protein crops to be carried out under strict compliance with the financial parameters agreed in Berlin .
We need - the whole Union needs - a strong Commission , a Commission which has regained its ability to act as a political entity and is recognisable as such in all its actions .
Can we be asked to take that risk in the EU ?
We can expect to live longer , and , when I say it is fortunate that there are more and more older people , I mean that in the sense that major issues always bring with them new ideas and innovation , so it may well be that the EU of 25 or 27 will thereby be turned into a humane society founded upon solidarity .
I am afraid that the Commission will now be flooded with maps of domestic rivers all over Europe .
Evaluation means downgrading rather than improving the quality of universities and makes provision for them not to fulfil their social mission , but to increase the profitability of capital through opportunistic study and research subjects tailored to the market .
However , there are additional strategies open to our Member States .
What we are calling for is a balanced policy , which implies a stable currency and effective budgetary consolidation as well as the need to ensure adequate purchasing power .
There is also a concern of the rapporteur which we share , relating to the marketing of recycled products , which involves very many difficulties and , like the rapporteur , I believe that the public administrations must have these opportunities to contract recycled products .
The migration of health workers is already a considerable problem .
Lastly , it is vital to boost the Observatory &apos;s capacity for monitoring new developments such as new consumption models for audiovisual products , in particular videogames and the Internet .
Commissioner , may I remind you that any project for reform requires two things : it has to take account of the recommendations and results of its own investigations and it has to inform the Members of this House in advance of the precise direction the proposal is to take , especially when it comes to its more controversial aspects .
We would see some results from that by the year 2050 at the earliest .
Thirdly , we cannot accept Amendments Nos 44 and 48 because they introduce measures which have not been adequately studied or in connection with which there is not , as yet , the requisite scientific data , but which will be attended to , however , in the second phase of the Auto / Oil programme .
Madam President , I should like to dispute the fact that Mr Liese , whom we all know , would insinuate something .
Mr President , this is the first time that these three programmes have been bunched together in this way , creating a Europe of knowledge .
I believe that was a very sensible decision on the part of the Bureau .
Certainly , there is no single magic solution to bridge the gap between European politics and our citizens and there is no simple way to meet the democratic aspirations of citizens and their desire to be more actively involved .
I think that this problem that has come up , which must be examined and presented realistically , has been satisfactorily resolved .
Also in this report we propose that the Community institutions and the Member States should declare 22 February as International Equal Pay Day .
Mrs Harkin raises an issue that is very relevant today with an increasing proportion of our population getting progressively older .
Finally , we might ask why the European Union &apos;s policy on China is so incoherent and inconsistent , and what we can do about it .
I believe we should increase their rate of absorption and accelerate those funds , aiming for a significant impact on improving competitiveness and employment .
With this common text that we have created we have succeeded , through the removal of the country of origin principle , for one thing , in protecting the rights of workers , namely labour law , social law , consumer protection and other important issues relating to rights , and in ensuring that we have a positive regulation .
It underlines the focus on Europe and on European values .
This Parliament , which condemned Italy and its government for the criminal act of deportation to Libya , must now act consistently , which is the reason why we are calling on the groups which voted with us for the resolution on Lampedusa to now draw up a resolution condemning the events in Ceuta and Melilla .
Cooperation to combat organised crime is an important task for the EU .
Of course , both good and bad things might be said about such negotiations , but the fact is that there is no question of objectivity .
This has not happened . What we have is a number of small cautious steps improving and deepening integration .
I believe that all these points have to be considered very carefully ; the fact that money has been spent on it already is no reason to finish building something that is neither safe nor economical .
Taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments (
Before we begin I would like to advise you that , since this is a night sitting and we have a lot of work to get through , I am going to be very strict in applying time limits .
Likewise , we could easily formulate a common objective for energy efficiency in the Alterner II programme .
We need to continue to work to generate more solidarity and maintain the social value desired by everyone who has been involved in creating and launching this directive .
The Commission considers that the compromise package that will be voted on shortly improves both on the Commission proposal and on the common position .
On behalf of the committee and personally I want to ask Commissioner Bangemann where the Commission now stands on this proposal ?
For this reason a single management database has been set up , covering all infringement files opened by the Commission and covering data on the transposal of directives by Member States .
You are not even following the line taken at the Tampere Council .
- Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , my friend and colleague Mr Lambsdorff has already spoken on behalf of the group and poked fun at me , on behalf of the Liberal component of the group , by describing the glass as half full .
For example , if it is a question of descending on human rights organisations - indefensible .
In the field of freedom , security and justice , the European Union has , in the last 10 years , gone from the application of the free circulation of persons to a common policy .
I call on Parliament to put pressure on the Commission and the South African Government to end this situation .
I must say that with some results I have a strong urge to recommend a negative vote , mainly because I very much wonder what agreements and consultation really mean .
As to the healing effect of alcohol - to which , I believe , Mr Posselt also made reference - I could not agree more with him : I think that a good bottle of wine can be extremely good for your health and is also socially extremely pleasant , and perhaps Mr Posselt , Mr Andersson and myself could meet in the bar of this Parliament one of these days to share an aquavit .
That being said , the introduction of other kinds of criteria such as more selective production methods , which would lead to the implementation of an criterion . This would run counter to the principle that the effects on resources should be analysed on the basis of the decision on technical measures , and not afterwards .
. ( PT ) The Commission communication which serves as the basis for this report follows up the request made at the Spring Council in Barcelona to streamline the relevant policy coordination processes and to improve the implementation of the &apos; Lisbon strategy &apos; .
I think that the usual exercise of Brussels-bashing goes too far sometimes .
The method by which mass assaults on minorities are carried out was introduced by the famous Serbian secret service , the UDBA , aimed at ethnic Albanians in particular .
That does not mean , of course , that we should not try as hard as we can to encourage the provision of day care and make quality day care available for those who want to use it .
I agree also that training and education systems have an important role to play in creating a spirit of initiative , responsibility and entrepreneurship .
I would like to particularly congratulate the rapporteur , Mrs Schörling , as well as all members of the Conciliation Committee .
The report meets the priorities I feel we should have for our environment of reducing the production of non-reusable or non-recyclable waste , making producers and importers responsible for waste , avoiding the reclassification of energy recovery incinerators for waste disposal and introducing a requirement to develop national waste prevention programmes .
Yet I believe we have done justice to our task of verifying whether the Commission has met our demands in relation to the discharge .
The next item is the report ( A4-0067 / 99 ) by Mr Trakatellis , on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , on the proposal for a Council Regulation ( EC ) amending Regulation ( EEC ) No 2075 / 92 and fixing the premiums and guarantee thresholds for leaf tobacco by variety group and Member State for the 1999 , 2000 and 2001 harvests ( COM ( 98 ) 0633 - C4-0682 / 98-98 / 0306 ( CNS ) ) .
It is essential that the Council also takes its part of the responsibility and that at this stage it looks at it in conjunction with the other issues which I indicated .
I doubt whether a solution can be found without new elections .
Nor should there be any extra levels of decision-making that could interfere with operational effectiveness .
- Before the vote on Amendment 12 :
The proposals on the transparency of data provided by the Agency are heading in this direction .
That is the only thing they understand there .
Serious consideration must be given to the Irish decision to vote against ratification of the Treaty of Nice .
These are at present inadequate statutory forms of redress for such infringement at both ports and airports .
I shall take toys as an example .
It is a great pity that the success that we had hoped for is still to be achieved .
Perhaps the Commissioner could give us more details so that we are better aware of the agenda .
It is not possible to continue mismanaging funds without it being noticed .
The European Parliament and the Commission have approved a plan of management measures for fisheries in the Mediterranean .
Of all the emerging states in Eastern Europe , Hungary is the most advanced and most ready to participate in the MEDIA II programme , because its administrative and technical structures are at a more advanced level .
I am sure that our Belgian friends will be perfectly able to take the discussion forwards .
Recalling again the words of the French President , we must think very hard , once more , about how we structure this emission trading scheme .
As a Member from the north of France , I am aware of the difficulties which the establishment of a new European directive on the registration of persons sailing on board passenger ships to or from Member States &apos; ports would raise .
This is less a matter of financial assistance and more of when we will have a European &quot; feed-in directive &quot; with compensation that actually covers the costs .
What , however , do our own women and young people say about the fact that the future of the EU is now to be directed by those responsible for the majority of our laws &apos; now being adopted by officials and Ministers behind closed doors ?
Leading by example is a necessary requirement , but it is not enough on its own , as was demonstrated in Copenhagen .
Nevertheless I endorse both reports .
Mrs Marinucci is quite right , this is something we simply have to hold out for .
Clearly , a consensus reached by the Fifteen to this effect at the forthcoming Barcelona Summit would constitute the most negative signal that the European Union could give to those I call &apos; the people of Porto Alegre &apos; .
This should continue to be the approach in the years to come .
Unlike some Council members who consider the EU to be an additional cost , an expense to be reduced at the risk of pitting current and future policies against each other , Parliament , through the resolution on general guidelines for the preparation of the 2012 budget , has reiterated its vision of the Union as a vector of added value and an ally of Member States in implementing ambitious policies .
Providing direct information or advertising that is aimed at patients is not the right way forward .
I would also like to compliment the Commission and the Commission staff for their assistance .
Currently , travellers have poor service at a high cost .
As always in an engineering revolution , there will be winners and losers , but throughout the EU system we are working to ensure that European industry and European workers will be winners in this situation .
Where climate change is concerned , attention should first and foremost be paid to really sustainable alternatives .
What I would ask your House to do is to help us and the Commission get a majority for this target at the spring summit of the Heads of State or Government , for I regard it as one of the most important that we have to achieve .
One of the aims of the European Year of Education through Sport , as set out in the European Parliament and Council decision of February 2003 , is to take advantage of the values conveyed through sport to develop knowledge and skill , particularly amongst young people .
Mr President , the annual report and the statement of assurance relating to activities in connection with the general budget for the financial year 1996 identifies a list of shortcomings in the use of Community funds .
After this oral amendment was rejected , all of the amendments tabled in this House by the Left were adopted , yet the Left abstained from the final overall vote , which is evidence of their intention to manipulate an important overview of human rights to their own ends .
However , under the EIB &apos;s external mandate , this sense of urgency for counter-cyclical action has not been shown by the EIB in developing countries .
I should like to make a plea here today for the promotion of more Eurovision events through the medium of television .
In this matter , the qualitative aspects deserve as much attention as the quantitative aspects and elements .
This requires more and better public services , with a guarantee of equal access for all .
We shall speak of the efficient use of the division of labour that will develop smoothly in the enlarged single market , which is now assuming continental dimensions and which must compete successfully on a global scale with the Far East and North America .
Madam President , Croatia has a European vocation : the recent invitation to join NATO and the current negotiations to join the EU are a testimony to that .
The environmental statement is , of course , the visible public result of EMAS being implemented within an organisation .
Madam President , being with each other is better than being against each other ; cooperation within the framework of the Association Agreement is better than disputes in international organizations .
The Luxemburg socialists declare themselves to be clearly in favour of Mrs Ghilardotti &apos;s report .
While it may not seem all that illogical for the European Investment Bank to support , through its loans and guarantees , the Union &apos;s external policies , it is completely unacceptable for it to undermine European economic interests and contribute to the deindustrialisation of our countries .
( HU ) Mr President , in order to implement our first security strategy and fight terrorism and organised crime effectively , high quality law enforcement training in the European Union is indispensable : law enforcement training which is able to harmonise and raise to a unified level the very different law enforcement traditions and very different abilities of the various Member States .
One thing should be said : much is being said about flexibility here , but the Parliament gave another demonstration just now of how inflexibly we venture to manage our own Regulations .
In summary , something can be done now , unemployment can be reduced , Europe can be strengthened for the future .
This is an important issue but it is not the only one .
I would ask this House to regard Mr Barroso &apos;s statements yesterday as also relating to Ukraine , as this is another instance in which we should not be timid and apprehensive .
We have studied very carefully the rhythm which the airports could impose with the withdrawal of aircraft from the fleets in question and we are convinced that this reference should be made according to movements .
We must not let this man get away with it . We must ensure that we take targeted measures to stop Mr Mugabe in time , and I call on us all to do so .
In order to ensure effective freedom of the press , government institutions must be prepared to defend freedom of expression and to foster its development , which is the most important thing ensuring the fundamental values and rights of the European Union .
Ladies and gentlemen , let us , with all the representatives of the Member States , not be afraid of making decisions or of the decisions that may be taken .
Once again , I would stress the need to simplify the rules , as well as consumer protection , the role of the national regulatory authorities and the licensing system which has been discussed at great length .
This technical terminology is misleading in the extreme , however , in that it covers enormous differences in the development levels of individual regions .
Mr President , my colleagues , on behalf of my group I thank the rapporteurs for the preparation of their fine reports , and also for the good outcomes in conciliation .
Finally , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Alves , and thank the Commission and the Council who , along with Parliament , have succeeded in reaching an agreement in this first trialogue on agriculture .
The European Union &apos;s operation , known as the EUFOR Chad-Central African Republic operation , will be conducted for one year from the date of declaration of the initial operational capability and will be neutral and impartial .
There is no reason to make a distinction between public and private life .
The imposition of a minimum jail sentence of six years , or ten years where the circumstances make the crime more serious , should be sufficient to bring trafficking in human beings within the scope of other instruments already adopted for the purposes of enhancing police and judicial cooperation in the European Union against organised crime .
. Mr President , I should like to condemn strongly the recent spate of violence in Sri Lanka .
I take his point that this will expand the range and level of liability of nuclear operators , but it remains the case , unhappily , that nuclear power still travels in a boat of its own , subject to a rather special exception to the &apos; polluter-pays &apos; principle - the polluter pays quite a lot , but not necessarily everything in that case .
Mrs Rosemarie Müller ( A5-0330 / 2002 ) on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down Community procedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for human and veterinary use and establishing a European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products &#91; COM ( 2001 ) 404 - C5-0591 / 2001 - 2001 / 0252 ( COD ) &#93; ;
We must all prevent visa restrictions , which were imposed in the case of Kosovo , for example , which brought shame on every one of us .
The European Union has already been obliged to review the statistics relating to a Member State &apos;s budget deficit and level of debt ; now several Member States want to join the euro zone , so the volume of statistical information to be processed will increase , as will the number of parties involved in the discussions .
I hope that all possible steps are going to be taken to complete negotiations in 2004 , ideally by May 2004 . This would send a very powerful message to the people of Bulgaria .
The energy used by buildings represents almost one third of the total energy used in the European Union .
This is where the main obstacles lie .
We occasionally sent notes to each other , like schoolboys , when we had overlapping issues in our reports , in order to achieve the same wording .
On small and medium-sized enterprises the Commission is against their total exemption from the proposal , but it is willing to find a cost-effective solution that would ensure that SMEs should have access to capital markets at the right price and under the right levels of regulation with the necessary investor protection .
We promote democracy , human rights and freedom of expression , and can under no circumstances approve of terrorism .
To avoid any explosion of the gross resources , which would have to be redistributed between Member States , this option would have to involve a system of partial reimbursement of negative budgetary balances above a certain threshold .
As your colleague , Mr Barnier , said - and this is written in black and white - you lack the legal and moral basis to reform the Structural Funds now .
However , some areas in the EU do not even have a regional gas market .
The second issue is related to the European Union &apos;s capacity to manage crises .
We have all heard of the problems linked to free movement : one couple being accepted , for instance , in the Netherlands but not being accepted and getting the same rights - social or otherwise - for instance , in Italy .
We are moving up the value chain in what we produce .
The EUR 40 million we have proposed for 2003 is therefore intended to provide for assistance to flow as rapidly as possible to support Iraq via the UN and its specialised agencies .
The report points out that sports at school is unattractive .
Madam President , everyone here is aware of the importance of this subject .
This goal will never be reached with the SEAN project , which is based on an increase of two gigabits per second per year .
Now , as speaker on behalf of the Socialist Group , let me just make a comment on the accusation levelled against the Socialist Group by Mrs Müller .
It must be stated , firstly , that the duty to provide assistance is not legally binding , secondly , that the use of military means is not necessarily required and , thirdly , that the individual Member States retain the freedom to decide what the assistance they provide actually comprises .
It would make sense , if anything , to defer both reports , so as to take a fresh look at matters , but since this is not being done , that would not appear to be possible .
It is not absurd to tell these countries to find the way to reconciliation , because we ourselves set an example of such reconciliation sixty years ago .
We should therefore capitalise on the European added value and give the Agency the necessary competences to reach a uniform approach without , however , overlooking the Member States &quot; know-how .
We want solutions which reflect the tragedy .
Mr President , when the International Women &apos;s Day was launched , the equality of women was a brand new and revolutionary idea .
At the risk of being suspected of reverting provocatively to earlier discussions in Parliament , I very much hope that the important programmes that we are trying to launch in the Balkans will not be held hostage as Parliament and the Council argue and disagree about funding for next year .
This is the only compulsory conference that must meet to review the Rome Statute if necessary and evaluate the extremely important step forward that is the International Criminal Court .
I am convinced that this is a sensible way of proceeding at the moment , to ensure that we assemble all the information required and arrive at conclusions soundly based on facts .
He was working on the anti-trust investigation into Microsoft and he leaves to join that company .
Mr President , I wish to begin by thanking Mr Florenz for the work carried out in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection and for the cooperation with the Commission .
in writing . - ( DE ) The European Parliament motion for a resolution on the situation in Tunisia supports the efforts of the Tunisian people to move towards democracy .
We are , then , prepared to come to a speedy agreement - indeed , the whole point is that we desire one - but such an agreement is not to be had at any price .
We are not undermining the Commission &apos;s proposal .
So I wholeheartedly agree with the establishment of the public-private partnership arrangement to ensure that the monies and the extra revenues which are created because of the single market within the European Union are put back into the European Union rather than allowing money which is invested in pension funds and so on to be invested in countries outside the European Union , which means that the Union as a whole loses all that money .
To achieve this , we want primarily to increase the possibilities of financing the creative sector , as a pillar of intelligent economic growth , from the Union budget .
This approach gives credit for the steps already taken by those countries and is in line with the general incentive-based approach that underpins the GSP + .
I am particularly pleased about the improvements in the information requirements for door-to-door selling and for distance contracts .
( PT ) Mr President , this legislative package is not an answer to the severe economic and social problems being experienced in many countries , which are affecting workers and people in general .
On the other , there is a whole economic sector , from breeders to processors and distributors , which is on the verge of despair because its very survival is under threat .
The PSE Group wants to take Amendment 6 as an addition to paragraph 5 .
The European Commission &apos;s lack of consistency over energy as well as farming subsidies is also regrettable .
We could then continue the debate this afternoon , and possibly vote this evening .
I will finish by saying that individuals are sometimes caught by the system , whereas major players and others who might be more guilty of an element of fraud are perhaps less likely to be caught .
At this stage , the fundamental question is : do we want a directive or not ?
The EU should work to increase access to such care services in the Member States .
I intend to contribute to the coordination of Member States &apos; deliberations desired by the Presidency by sending ministers information , particularly on the Unesco process , in order to stimulate the debate between the European nations on this matter .
It is just as Mrs Müller said . These external policy reports which we get from the Court of Auditors have become interchangeable .
I thank the High Representative for promising us complete information and transparency .
Unfortunately the pact will be half open because the amendment to Article 136 , as debated and voted in our Committee on Constitutional Affairs has fallen .
We are already witnessing that .
It has been recast into a document of some 300 articles , which is now comprehensible and which can , therefore , be better implemented .
Like Mrs Ries , I in turn would like to stress the need for preventive measures in all the different fields of action , and in all the points that have been mentioned in your work .
However , the market price of energy is only one side of the problem .
Those decisions will allow us to look more confidently to the present and the future - I &apos;m just finishing , Mr President - and I believe that they will also make it possible to give a convincing response to legitimate European concerns .
The issue is a serious one and one that concerns the health of all our citizens , since the latest studies prove just how dangerous particle emissions really are .
( PL ) Mr President , the proposed system for the transfer and accumulation of credits in the field of education and vocational training should contribute to the mobility of workers within the borders of the European Union .
The draft bill also goes against the United Nations declaration on sexual orientation and gender identity .
The Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats made a particularly valuable contribution to this Convention , something which as a young MEP I was particularly glad to see .
Your comment has been noted .
The strength of our relationship allows us to discuss these matters frankly .
Use of the system proposed in this compromise would not enable the consumer to make a conscious choice .
the oral question to the Commission by Mr Markov , on behalf of the Committee on International Trade , on the agreement establishing a framework for an Economic Partnership Agreement between the European Community and its Member States , of the one part , and the East African Community Partner States , of the other part - B6-0214 / 2009 ) ,
I think our Committee , the Committee on Transport , is right to assert that the decision as to whether or not the ship sails should be taken at the discretion of the captain , who must of course explain the reasons for his decision .
My second point is that we have standards , whether national or European , which give pride of place to the principle of mutual recognition and thereby make competition in the market possible .
So that environmental work does not lose momentum , it is no doubt desirable to have a programme with timetables and practical objectives to adhere to when enlargement takes place .
I should like to address myself primarily to the President of the ECOFIN Council .
And , given your character , I have no reason to doubt this . I would therefore like , in this spirit , Mr President , to wish you good luck .
Our dialogue with China - in which I have taken part myself - is very open and direct .
The resolution on which this report is based talks about the horrors of the war in former Yugoslavia , with Christians oppressing Muslims - at least that is one element of it - the massacres in Rwanda and Burundi , the blind fanaticism of Rabin &apos;s assassins - clearly the intention is to include Jewish fundamentalism - and the suicide bombers in Israel - Muslim fundamentalism .
I would also like to take this opportunity to reiterate that beating about the bush is no longer acceptable : a project of such strategic importance for all European citizens for the next 20 years can no longer be held up by squabbles over minor details .
I would specifically like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Parish , and the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , for all the work they have been doing .
I propose that we draw the conclusion and take this into account in terms of local government and administrative reform .
In the case of Kosovo , that means contributing in particular to strengthening of the rule of law , respect for human rights and the protection of minorities , as well as encouraging economic development and working for the protection of Kosovo &apos;s rich cultural and religious heritage .
In fact they are declining to do that , so a lot of work also remains to be done here .
. ( NL ) One of the hallmarks of capitalism is that companies are also commodities in their own right .
Even though I support the content of this agreement , I decided to abstain in the vote in order to protest against the political choices that the Brazilian Government has been taking for some time with regard to Cesare Battisti .
How do companies actually raise debt and equity finance across the European Union ?
You are perhaps not aware of this , but extensive animal tests are needed , for example , in order to be able to verify this sort of claim .
The first concerns the balance between freedom and security .
Of course , it is unacceptable to destroy the livelihoods of thousands of tobacco farmers without assistance with restructuring .
It is time for a major revision of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive , not least because the renewables roadmap needs to be considered hand in hand with the EU &apos;s action plan on energy efficiency .
However , there remain significant gaps in the full implementation of this legislation .
The doling out of tax money to parties , as well as the imposing of rules on parties by the government adds to the mistrust on the part of the citizens against what they see as a political elite .
We cannot compare terrorism with Israel &apos;s military decisions , or with the human rights violations that we do nonetheless condemn , but if Hamas &apos; decision-making powers are in the hands of the media-dependent butchers from Syria and Iran , what can the MEPs &quot; feeble requests to the Hamas government accomplish ?
No progress has been made on the mutual recognition of judgments and we are still a long way off from implementing the principle of the mutual recognition of sentencing .
The Committee framework will offer the opportunity for greater governance when countries fail to support regions and local authorities .
I think it is appropriate at this point to express thanks to Commissioner Piebalgs , who had a very difficult task , because making a European energy market out of the 27 separate markets of the individual Member States is a remarkable undertaking , it is a labour of Sisyphus which will not end with this term , and there will certainly be many tasks remaining for our successors .
There are huge gaps in the budgetary promises that have been made .
The next item is the debate on report ( A5-0394 / 2002 ) by Mr Wijkman , on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation , on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Regulation on aid for poverty diseases ( HIV / AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis ) in developing countries ( COM ( 2002 ) 109 - C5-0100 / 2002 - 2002 / 0051 ( COD ) ) .
Secondly , we took a vote in the Committee on Budgets whereby we increased substantially the budget for the Frontex Agency to almost EUR 35 million , so that it can strengthen its operations at our external borders .
Mr President , I must confess that when I first heard of the Ariane project , I thought &apos; What on earth are we talking about ? &apos;
The committee also decided by a majority vote to increase the funding of the programme and to diversify the funding targets in some respects , as set out in Amendments Nos 19 , 9 and 15 .
There would be special access for highly educated workers , with very high requirements in relation to the level of education and professional experience of the person in question , and with a minimum salary that , in Sweden for example , would have to amount to at least SEK 43.000 or EUR 4.300 per month .
However , on a more positive note , while the Commission is unable to finance housing as such , it tries to contribute to efforts combating homelessness and the social effects of poor housing .
I believe that a European identity and culture must be built on the basis of dialogue and contact with cultures other than those that have in recent years promoted and paved the way for the dissemination and the growth of a European idea , a European culture .
Through its Temporary Committees of Enquiry , it followed with great vigilance the way the European Commission and the Member States managed the crisis .
In this spirit , Madam President , I would like to make it clear . We shall give an equally clear response to the clear statement by the Commissioner when we have all the facts and all the documents .
This represents an imposition of the will of the political class upon the citizens .
That is all we are talking about .
Firstly , though , I must say to the rapporteur that to me it is a mistake in this report to give in to a fear of what must be politically correct , in other words the thought crime of so-called racism - I do say so-called racism ! - because obviously I am only talking about the idea of national preference , to equate the idea with real crimes like paedophilia .
I can add some more information : for example , documents have disappeared in the committee , something which is entirely inexplicable .
But we must just make sure - and the President must make sure - that Parliament is not left stranded by the Council &apos;s inability to follow his lead .
But at the same time other variables , such as the significant increase in productivity , have not been taken into account .
Lastly , in terms of external policy , the EU must impress upon the future major world powers , such as China , India and Brazil , that the various development processes must take place on the basis of a balance between social and economic policy .
In the belief it would be more right to follow the Commission &apos;s line , I ask you to vote against my own report , from which I will , in any event , be withdrawing my signature , believing as I do that cheques with nothing to back them up are of no use in gaining acceptance for European policy or in buying safety for atomic energy .
The next trilogue is to be held as soon as next Thursday , when we will have the first opportunity to do interinstitutional work on the basis of the Commission proposal , in order to be able to create in good time the framework for the first Budget for a 25-Member European Union .
It is currently permitted to grant State aid for the production and processing of various agricultural products listed in Annex I to the EC Treaty , if three different criteria are fulfilled .
For , since forever and a day , the ECOFIN Council has been working on pensions , but viewed from the angle of the Stability Pact and the broad economic guidelines and , thus , only from the point of view of the fundability of pensions .
Everything must be done to prevent the humanitarian situation from deteriorating further .
Rather than striving towards settlement or peace with the Jewish state , we should tear out its page from history , for that is what Khomeini called for , and , according to the present Iranian President Ahmadinejad , those are words of wisdom .
And we know that Catherine , Kim and Carola are dead , though we do not as yet know the circumstances .
If we break them because they do not suit us , other countries will break their commitments when it suits them but does not suit us .
B5-0164 / 2000 by Mr Leinen on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists ,
It was reflected in your strong Parliamentary delegation in Bonn .
The European Parliament , by means of its competent committees , will have to organize these relations .
Accordingly , expenditure under next year &apos;s budget is 1.11 % , while the own resources ceiling is 1.27 % .
The adoption of an Indicator of Language Competence is needed to redress the lack of verifiable data on the EU citizens &apos; language skills .
Whether they are German , French or Spanish car manufacturers , it seems to me that similar failures and similar troubles also befall people in the less developed states , in the small Member States .
Industry is keen to have clarity and to start rightaway .
It is just not good enough for us to talk and talk and talk : we need to have people on the ground , instruments for monitoring elections , good governance and all the other things for which we require funds .
Crimes must be punished and crimes involving xenophobia and racism must be punished even harder . Racism must be considered an aggravating factor when punishment is meted out .
I therefore call for due consideration in the 2005 budget of at least the main areas of action of the common fisheries policy .
on behalf of the S &amp; D Group . - Mr President , the Socialist and Democrat Group of course welcome the advance in the four key areas of balanced information , the country-of-origin principle , and so on . Commissioner , of course we welcome it .
We welcome the human rights dialogue with China and Iran .
According to the United Nations , the cost of the damage is likely to be several times that of last December &apos;s tsunami .
I hope that , at least in the future , some sort of order can be re-established ; if this is not the case , then tell us clearly that Parliament &apos; s work is in the hands of the Presidency and not the Rules of Procedure .
( FR ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to congratulate all the rapporteurs , who have answered the big questions raised by the challenges of maritime safety and have faced up to our responsibilities .
I cannot quite follow this line of thought .
I , though , would like to be a little less discreet by saying that it is clear that this Presidency , up to the end of June , and the next one will have to ask themselves whether , with regard to the opening of accession negotiations with Turkey , we can make it seem that , and act as if , nothing had changed since December 2004 , as if Turkey had not slackened its efforts , as if Europe had produced a Constitution and as if it had produced a budget : it has no Constitution , it has no budget and Turkey has slackened its efforts .
And in this regard , Madam President , we keenly await the report to be presented by Mr Solana and which Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck has announced .
However , we are opposed to the wording in the report that calls for European guidelines for coverage of mental health by the media .
It will require education and addressing the culture that we live in ; it requires addressing the attitudes of our media .
I have to say that the situation relating to the Commission &apos;s legal powers is precisely as I set it out in my initial statement .
2006 is European Year of Workers &quot; Mobility , and the EU &apos;s efforts to encourage European mobility in general , and not merely of workers , should ensure that mobile telephone users should not have to pay higher charges just because they are abroad .
Setting the legal framework for entrepreneurship , stimulating growth , they are all well and good , but above all putting public finances in order once again in the Member States - that is the challenge .
The free trade agreement would also present a useful point of reference for other negotiations . Moreover , concluding that agreement now would demonstrate the commitment of both sides to open markets as one response to the current economic environment .
It is probably a linguistic issue .
As draftsman of the opinion on the proposal for a CITES Regulation , I should like to say that I am particularly satisfied , because the Council &apos;s common position endorses the opinion tabled at first reading by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy .
Agricultural spending has maintained the same level for the last ten years , while the number of farmers has dropped from something like 12 million 10 years ago , to 6 million today .
Otherwise , Turkey will say tomorrow that it had been promised membership if it favoured an agreement that brought the secession of the north of the island to an end .
That is really what we are discussing here .
We are doing our very best at this stage , but it is crucial , if we find a solution , for it to be a balanced solution - within the three pillars of agriculture but also between agriculture , industrial products and services .
The first step along that road is having the courage to speak the truth in all friendliness , however uncomfortable or inconvenient that truth may be .
There are no plans to follow the procedure involving concurrent statements in Parliament in connection with such decisions .
This would not allow us to meet new challenges .
You will be aware that in the first part of the draft constitution , Articles 3 and 4 provide that the Union shall combat exclusion and discrimination and provide social justice and protection , equality between women and men , solidarity between generations and protection of children &apos;s rights .
Naturally , being overweight causes a range of chronic illnesses and that is why what we eat as food is important .
The violence against women and young girls is one of the most heinous violations of human rights in that Islamic state .
I would be far more interested in protecting the residents of my constituency , the West Midlands in the UK , against the action of the Convention on Human Rights .
The African Union has become the organisation that establishes norms , not only in this sphere but also in that of political governance , on the African continent and in the process of economic integration .
They do not occupy a post in the establishment plan and they must work under the supervision of a permanent official or a temporary agent .
Nevertheless , despite the food and veterinary crises that have struck in recent years , and their impact on public and animal health , the interests of animal ration companies have taken precedence insofar as they have been granted derogations to the existing general ban ; for example , such companies are allowed to use fish flour , and the Commission is allowed to grant partial derogation for certain types of animal such as young ruminants .
The only thing is that the votes will be held on 5 and 6 May .
I should like to tell you that in Cyprus , the interest rate currently stands at 6 % .
But they also realize that no price can be put on every day of peace ; that in the short term the enlargement will imply a cost that we will have to carry together , but in the long term it will be an asset for the entire continent .
Finally , in a breathtaking lack of worker solidarity , that union prevented work from going ahead , which led to the company withdrawing from the contract and filing for bankruptcy .
Thirdly , we are greatly concerned at the cursory treatment in your programme of the issue of sustainable development and the urgent need to respond with practical , incisive action to the environmental challenges facing us .
Görlach report ( A4-0405 / 98 )
Since we have this power of codecision , we should put in an appearance and use it .
Globalisation is a reality that can be beneficial when it is fair and equitable .
We have not forgotten the whole chapter involving the BTB .
As regards the introduction of special labelling of origin , I can assure you that I will be positive in my approach to that .
But , furthermore , the third element of this proposal for a directive is the definition of Community rules for the creation , management and use of funds for dismantling nuclear power stations , with the aim of guaranteeing that the funds are sufficient and available .
Unfortunately , the Sri Lankan Government has been unwilling to allow the investigation to go ahead without its approval , unless the UN Member States unanimously insist .
The quality of wine from third countries is no better than that of our wine , but their wine is much cheaper .
A transitional coalition is an African approach that has over the years worked in a number of other countries such as Togo and the Democratic Republic of Congo .
We voted against this report , which &apos; welcomes the overall agreement on Budget 2010 &apos; , because this is a Community budget that already reflects the priorities set in the Treaty of Lisbon for a European Union that is increasingly neoliberal and militaristic and less and less concerned with economic and social cohesion .
Implementation of the Directive , including market surveillance and the monitoring of bodies charged with the task of certification by the Member States and notified to the Commission as such , has been made more efficient as a result of Parliament &apos;s far-reaching amendments at first reading .
Our basic concern is to concentrate all our attention on those actions which may improve on the results that we have so far obtained and which may make our efforts more productive .
Unfortunately , although I understand Mr Brok &apos;s motives from the perspective of parliamentary activity , we have to get something underway within a deadline which makes it difficult to weigh up properly and responsibly the dimensions and complex issues resulting from the content of this new structure .
In my opinion , however , it is not a question of deregulating all the sectors affected in the same way , irrespective of their different nature .
The final sum of EUR 312 may be more than the sum proposed by the Commission or the Council , but it does not satisfy me .
After having heard Prime Minister Guterres , the Minister of Foreign Affairs and yourself , I have confidence in the ambition of the Portuguese Presidency and the extremely proactive way in which it will conduct these negotiations .
These trends will continue to grow and there is no reason why they cannot be accommodated .
All this is very important , and it is also important for the quality of our fishery resources .
When assessing these three years , despite the difficulties of the American economy , we find that , in terms of growth , productivity levels and employment levels , we are further behind than three years ago .
As has already been stated here on several occasions , however , we need to do the opposite of what the stupid rules of the Stability Pact call for , which is forcing a reduction in public investment , leading to the State having no responsibility in the fields of health and education and making it difficult to use the Structural Funds correctly in the countries with the weakest economies .
For that reason , phased-in implementation is the right way to proceed .
It is also pathetic to read the wording in both these reports with regard to the funding of climate policy and energy policy .
the report ( A4-0168 / 99 ) by Mr Happart , on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , on the proposals for 16 Council Regulations on the prices for agricultural products ( 1999-2000 ) ( COM ( 99 ) 0038 - C4-0077 / 99 to C4-0091 / 99 and C4-0093 / 99-99 / 0025 ( CNS ) to 99 / 0039 ( CNS ) and 99 / 0801 ( CNS ) ) ; -the report ( A4-0164 / 99 ) by Mr Jové Peres , on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , onI.the proposal for a Council Regulation amending and correcting Regulation ( EC ) No 2200 / 96 on the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables ( COM ( 98 ) 0647 - C4-0709 / 98-98 / 0309 ( CNS ) ) II.the proposal for a Council Regulation amending Regulation ( EC ) No 2202 / 96 introducing a Community aid scheme for producers of certain citrus fruits ( COM ( 98 ) 0647 - C4-0710 / 98-98 / 0310 ( CNS ) ) ; -the report ( A4-0173 / 99 ) by Mr Fantuzzi , on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , on the proposal for a Council Regulation on measures to promote and provide information on agricultural products in third countries ( COM ( 98 ) 0683 - C4-0158 / 99-98 / 0330 ( CNS ) ) ; -the oral question ( B4-0159 / 99 ) by Mr Colino Salamanca , to the Commission , on imports of garlic from third countries .
Days which will remain in our memory , which will be an example for future generations : everybody working as one - Parliament , Council and Commission - for this great project , for this great ambition which is Europe .
The danger is that shares of the global market will be lost and the problem of unemployment made worse .
We will bring our proposals to the next meetings and we will take it from there .
It is the delegation &apos;s view that the directive is not of a sufficiently high quality .
The risk of that is too great .
I also have a positive opinion of the final version of the provisions of Chapter 5 on prohibited contractual terms .
Two factors have helped us reach the important decisions taken in Bali : Europe &apos;s position as world leader in combating climate change , and the scientific findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) .
I wish our Mexican colleagues and friends a successful stay in Strasbourg .
I make no secret of the fact that I would have preferred to present a proposal for a complete ban on advertising for tobacco products .
New techniques , such as marker vaccines make it possible to distinguish between a sick animal and one that has been vaccinated .
The amendment guarantees correct information and the free consent of donors of genetic material , independently of national provisions .
I would like you to know that hopefully , between the vote on Thursday and the not-too-distant future , we can all be in a position where we can see the Commission &apos;s proposals coming to fruition and we can get on with the job of making Europe the place that the citizens expect it to be and not associated with the great mystique that it represents for too many of them right now .
That is the respect that the Irish people have for you and your group .
Providing our budget with sufficient payment appropriations does not mean failing to comply with the austerity objectives , but to help the European Union &apos;s growth by means of its policies .
It is obvious that we need more efficiency in the decision-making process of Europe .
Mr President , many people have good experiences of using herbal medicine to supplement ordinary medicine and treatment .
I hope that , during this programme , the Erasmus programme for young entrepreneurs will also continue .
The guiding criterion for the Doha Round has been to involve all member countries in negotiations on a whole range of matters , whereas in such a broad-based organisation efforts should be made to develop a plurilateral approach incorporating a form of &apos; variable geometry &apos; .
Mrs Jackson also asked me whether , in view of the likelihood of concealment , we are getting good information and whether we have a proper rapid response team in place .
In my opinion , a massive subsidy for the energy sector is not a good solution because I feel that it is at variance with the current trend towards liberalisation and the creation of a competitive internal market .
This indicates that the Council and the governments are not giving priority to the issue of employment .
The Common Position reflects this desire to send a message of progress and looking forward rather than rigidity .
If we look at the reports from the election campaign we can see that consensus is difficult to reach even within the same party .
And acting responsibly includes analysing the underlying causes of the crisis and implementing the essential remedies to ensure that it does not recur elsewhere .
This is a very important and much needed initiative .
Otherwise we will never reach the tens of thousands of forced entrepreneurs who cannot afford the time or resources to enquire about them .
It is no longer acceptable that Community policy should neglect anti-noise policy and I am sure the Commission is aware of that .
One reason for this is that in reacting to the problems of the previous Commission , we perhaps added too many layers of futile controls .
Mr President , by including this item on the agenda within a very difficult international context and coinciding with the visit of President Fox and a large delegation of Mexican parliamentarians , we have wanted to stress this Parliament &apos;s interest in relations with the countries of Latin America on the eve of the Summit .
Clearly , the aim is to promote the EU &apos;s role in the sphere of foreign and security policy .
Dear Ahmet , you know that we are with you , that we support the democratic struggle your party is conducting in Turkey for the recognition of the fundamental rights of the Kurdish people .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I think these are very timely questions and this is a very important debate .
It is a happy coincidence that we should have the Head of State of an Accession Country to speak to us on an afternoon when we hear from the European Commission on the annual progress reports on the question of accession to the European Union .
Three minutes to decide whether we move the hotbeds of conflict in the Caucasus and the Middle East to Europe &apos;s boundaries .
Many of these programmes are unsuited to small and medium-sized enterprises , as only large projects requiring at least EUR 1 million are being supported .
I was not giving my own personal views but those of the Committee on Fisheries .
in writing . - Mr President , I welcome the notion that &apos; the Eastern Partnership should not hinder the European Union membership for neighbouring countries wishing to apply &apos; , as it was stated in the report .
Experience shows that in the past we succeeded in perfecting and improving the operation of our institutions by means of institutional agreements or internal reforms .
Making this a reality ten years on by admitting our central European neighbours as Members is a task of truly historic proportions .
The approval of IMF assistance as such is based on its own criteria and is tied to sustainable economic programmes proposed by the governments of the countries affected by financial or economic problems .
We know that one thing that economists agree on is that investment in education is something which will produce long-term results , growth and jobs , so I always urge governments not to cut university investment or education investment in general .
In spite of the high level of employment and high social standard in Austria , our citizens &apos; first wish is to see employment and high social standards in Europe .
At the same time the Eurozone has become an increasing factor in stabilising the world economy .
the recommendation ( A6-0294 / 2005 ) , on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , on the Council common position for adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council relating to emissions from air-conditioning systems in motor vehicles and amending Council Directive 70 / 156 / EEC &#91; 16056 / 5 / 2004 - C6-0221 / 2005 - 2003 / 0189A ( COD ) &#93; ( rapporteur : Avril Doyle ) .
Here in this House , in Spain and in many other countries , we have all fixed on El Ejido . Yet what we do and say here and the concern we express will really serve no purpose unless this leads to the adoption of a much more determined attitude to finding out what is really happening , not only in El Ejido , but in many other places where this type of problem may be occurring at any given moment .
The OSCE is therefore absolutely important , for example , in central Asia , whether it has to do with supporting the work of the police , drug prevention or improved border security .
If the Christian Democrats vote in favour of urgency , they can never again complain about state aids or competition policy in this European Parliament .
It lays down that slurry processed into biogas suddenly becomes a waste product .
Trade-policy instruments naturally include antidumping measures and WTO procedures in places where state interference is pushing down the price of exports .
We never liked the Treaty of Nice .
Then everything is fine and what gets mentioned is the excellent cooperation with the Council .
It is important to recall here the trips , the presentations , the hearings , the documents , etc . We know that in Denmark a pilot detected that the Prestige was not seaworthy and yet allowed it to continue sailing ; we know that the classification society had clearly not complied with its duties to inspect the repairs ; we know that the vessel had carried out a series of bunkering operations , 174 times , and that it cracked in those same places where it had been repaired .
This important issue has come to the attention of many MEPs following the BBC documentary Bulgaria &apos;s abandoned children , which focused on care homes for children with disabilities .
But only two out of seven Member States with no vulnerable zones have now made their designations and only two out of ten in breach of the action programmes - the critical application - have established them .
Thirdly , after consultation with , amongst others , the German presidency and the British Home Office , I have been more specific about some of the tasks which this new committee should carry out .
I shall give you a very simple example .
It should , however , be possible to build such a one-stop-shop in this advanced electronic age .
I would like to focus on one point here . I believe that we in Europe and here in the European Parliament must answer one question very clearly , a question that is fundamental to this whole discussion : generally speaking , do we in Europe want to take in immigrants or not ?
It is a fact that , although we hope to see much more of a modal shift in the future , at present most goods are carried by road .
It paid scant regard to the interests of creditors , employees , consumers and small suppliers .
Every child has a right to have a family , which is the basis of his upbringing .
In such cases a family member can assert his or her right to family reunion .
But first let us use all the multilateral and European peace mechanisms that are in place .
It would be unfortunate if the Union tried to interfere in that management through environmental issues .
What will remain of that conference when everything has been forgotten ?
Those with the patience to reread the introductory statements made by our presidency at the beginning of the term would find the issue of employment at the centre of our programme .
Road tolls , import and customs procedures , and so on , in the areas at risk , mean that logistical capacity is not sufficient to ensure that food aid is delivered on time and without a hitch .
Contrary to what might be thought , this is not a simple matter of national sensitivity .
That is to say , we should define the conditions for mutual recognition of registered homeopathic products more carefully and then make mutual recognition a binding principle .
The quality of this process is now just as important as the number of chapters being negotiated .
Above all , the strategy must be an internal EU strategy , the general oversight of priority areas and objectives must therefore be within the Community structures and it should in no way be divisive for the EU , creating splits among the Member States .
In 2006 , however , the reference year , 99 % of papers were submitted in the right way , so I think that this issue is also moving in the right direction .
There are some proposals in the report which are not acceptable for other reasons .
I am sure we all agree that the terrible scourge of hunger in the world casts shame on all those who are in a position to prevent it . The figures speak for themselves .
That would amount to half of the net payments in my country , and that might well prove the answer to the problem .
That was the essence of the discussion on the European arrest warrant .
Since I am fairly new to this Parliament , I do not know how to deal with this , but I would at least recommend anyone who cares about the environment and who is in favour of the polluter pays principle , to vote for both split components .
We have already given in to the World Trade Organisation on many occasions .
First , I would like to draw your attention to the amendment to article 3 , allowing the scope of this directive to be extended to cover aircraft which , while operating with a company from within the European Union , are to all effects and purposes chartered from third countries -sometimes even with the crew included - to operate from Community airports .
Kosovo is , of course , also a very important partner in this .
Mr Barroso is right when he says that without an economic union , we can forget the monetary union .
We have not only raised the issue of ice strengthening , in other words , specific safety measures for oil tankers in areas of ice formation , particularly , amongst others , the Baltic sea , with regard to a specific regulation in the European Union , but also within the International Maritime Organisation .
The initiative will take place on 18 October this year .
It has to be clear to us that Russia will , without a doubt , be needed as a partner in energy policy , and above all as a partner in the resolution of conflicts around the globe - be they in Iran , in the Middle East or anywhere else - and that it will try to cooperate as our equal and with equal rights , and that equal status is something that we must concede to Russia just as we do to all our other partners .
On the margins of the current transatlantic negotiations on data protection ( SWIFT , PNR ) , the United States is expanding its National Security Agency data-collection facilities so as to intercept every electronic message within its territory as well as all messages coming in and out of the country .
Mr President , Commissioner , to speak about summer time at 11.30 at night in winter instils a degree of nostalgia in one .
This figure may be based on possible estimates , but these have no normative character as such .
We agreed that we needed to incorporate the concept of conflict prevention in existing policy instruments to strengthen cooperation with the United Nations , the OSCE and other regional organisations and to find common approaches to cross-border phenomena of destabilisation such as the trade in narcotics , weapons or diamonds .
I think it is an extremely negative message to send out to the rest of the world if we talk about exemptions for emissions trading for the next decade .
Let me start with the statement by the President-in-Office of the Council to the effect that negotiations with Croatia , a country crucial to the stability of the region as a whole , could begin only as and when Mr Gotovina is extradited .
But , above all , our objective has been to strengthen unity on the operation of trade defence instruments in order to make them more workable , and it is not my job as Commissioner to weaken that unity .
Looking on the bright side - who knows ? - perhaps this directive may help in time to turn up some of the countless millions that have been embezzled from the European Union .
We are not voting in favour of the Hughes report on the Social Action Programme 1998-2000 , since it contains proposals for directives on workers &apos; individual and collective rights and the social regime which will disregard the Danish system of agreements .
I am now able to give the European Parliament the list of areas in which the regulations allow us to intervene as well as how the European Investment Bank envisages the way it will be done .
Even then , they set up their own administration and education and boycotted all state institutions .
I think we are all agreed in the House that there has to be such a proposal , not only because this is the wish of consumers , but also because there are other considerations which make it necessary .
In Germany , for example , and admittedly in many other States too - very thoroughly listed by the Commission in the Green Paper - there are a whole range of highly exotic regulations .
We will all be making greater use of this DRM , but it will not be as successful as we want without interoperability .
In the institutions of absolute immunity and immunity laid down by the Protocol on the Privileges and Immunities of the European Communities , the European Parliament has the - albeit limited - tools to defend itself against attacks on its independence or autonomy by other public or private authorities .
Europe must , I feel , today establish a genuine co-development policy related to migratory flows , which should , Mr President , centre on a few simple proposals , such as the framing of aid policies for projects by migrants , devising instruments for channelling the savings of immigrants , the placement of students in training and the placement of young trainees .
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to make a few comments on this debate , which has revealed great unity , not just between Council and Commission but also between these institutions and Parliament .
Ladies and gentlemen in Europe , do not waver around the next war in this way .
For instance , reports on site visits should be available within two months of the inspection taking place .
We would like to contribute to the strengthening of the realisation that the Roma , like all peoples and ethnic groups of Europe and the entire world , are not a problem , but an economic , cultural and human resource .
It is clear that we have a great potential ( savings up to 40 % ) for water saving through technological improvements , changes in human behaviour and production patterns , which should replace the current crisis management style .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we all agree that this proposal is very significant for port services insofar as it affects one of the most important transport infrastructures of the European maritime regions and because of the process of liberalisation of access to the market in these services .
One of these problems is the demographic crisis , which affects all of Europe .
The European Commission has already formulated its objections , and the Hungarian Government has shown willingness to amend the law .
It is absolutely essential that steps should now be taken to make ambitious proposals for the time after 2012 .
If we are to do this , the relevant specialised fora and the Commission have to keep us up to date with the work they are doing , and Parliament has to be consulted in good time before every European Council .
It makes sense to emerge from very long drawn-out extradition proceedings .
The first part of the quote comes from the draft Amsterdam text , which sets a deadline of five years for the abolition of all border controls within the EU for citizens of Member States and for third country nationals .
The rapporteur , Mrs Maes , whom I would like to thank , has agreed to this new proposal and the Commission is satisfied with the report adopted by the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism .
After all , that is what the introduction of new factors and the increased compensation with retroactive effect will achieve .
An information scheme using every possible means , from personal contact meetings to the use of modern technology , is needed to help overcome the dearth of information and other barriers which exist .
If Europe is going to be even weaker , as right-wing governments desire , it will be increasingly tempting to ask ourselves whether remaining in Europe still makes sense , as the Italian Interior Minister , Mr Maroni , has done .
In this respect I must say that , in terms of your commitment to a political union , to which we are favourable , this cannot be achieved unless it is based on our social model , on our originality and our capacity to better regulate the business of this world .
Thanks to this war over gas provision , energy matters have risen to the forefront , especially the realisation of the need for a common energy policy .
The resolutions submitted by Parliament contain a few important points . First of all , we as groups mutually agreed during the negotiations to urge the President and the Congress of the United States to review their position on taking part in the International Criminal Court .
It is highly unlikely that the human rights situation will improve under a President Dmitry Medvedev enthroned by Putin .
As a result , parties in other Member States that stand for the interests of their own countries are little concern of ours .
On the contrary , I believe that the status quo is not something we can profit by . Instead , we have everything to gain from a new round because there is so much greater understanding today of these complex connections and of the fact that development questions and environmental questions have to be discussed in the one context .
European financing would therefore make it possible to by-pass and thwart national efforts to clean up the funding of political parties and apply strict conditions to make it transparent .
Mr President , I regret Mr Lannoye &apos;s decision to withdraw his name from the report .
Let us not back down in the face of those people who do not want a democratic and transparent Europe , but an opaque Europe made up of diplomats .
It is an important sector in terms of volume of business , the number of workers , its distribution in various European countries and its particular concentration in certain regions .
Mr President , Mrs Diamantopoulou , ladies and gentlemen , these are the points that I wanted to make , on behalf of my group .
I am surprised , however , at the fact that many want to achieve this by means of Community policy .
This is a job for the High Commissioner for Refugees , and it is our task to resettle the individuals identified by the HCR . It is also a job for community-based organisations , which , at the moment , are extremely thin on the ground and need to be strengthened by all means possible .
In other words , the European Constitution will help so that we can have a more efficient Europe .
The Council will actively continue to urge and encourage Turkey to carry out reforms in the areas brought up by Mrs Maes , as there is much room for improvement .
Mr President , Commissioner Monti , we all realise that we are facing a crisis in terms of our press and communications policy for the Union &apos;s institutions .
rapporteur . - ( PT ) It is with regret that I would first of all like to say that the Commissioner has not heeded what virtually all Members have said and what the report states with regard to the 1.000 metres .
What this Union is for is described in our speeches today .
My colleagues will deal with this in greater detail from their own respective points of view .
I do so precisely because they are at the heart of the Pact of Confidence which I launched in this House , a year ago now , and which we are now in the process of turning into a reality .
If I feel that my dignity and identity are being suppressed , then I turn to separatism .
If the Irish have understood the situation properly , it seems to me that they have been happy for all of Europe to stand alongside Ireland when the financial storm almost carried Ireland away , and very happy for the President of the Commission to find a solution - something that was not easy - when first off the Irish Government had gone so far as to guarantee all the banks , all banking products , forgetting , just for a moment , that foreign banks in Ireland had to be treated in the same way as the Irish banks in Ireland .
Unfortunately , the European Parliament does not have the courage to condemn the situation of the Christian martyrs in Iran .
I think that the Frontex Agency will develop and broaden its responsibilities in accordance with needs and , of course , the will of the Member States .
According to the Commission , the safety measures in very small airports had to be adapted because they were difficult to put into practice .
A 3 % target for investment in research was set in Barcelona , but it is beginning to look like my New Year &apos;s resolution - to eat less and take more exercise - in that it has not been kept and really needs a bit more effort !
That is , then , in the first instance , a legal opinion rather than a political one .
A political Euro-Mediterranean conference was held on Malta on 15 and 16 April 1997 and demonstrated the importance which everyone attaches to the EuroMediterranean process .
Science can tell us in which direction fisheries should move in order to improve yields and decrease costs .
In the first year of SOLVIT being operational , Lithuania dealt with 10 complaints . Seven of these complaints were directed against Lithuania and three were directed by Lithuania against other states .
Are we not celebrating the tenth anniversary of the International Convention on the Rights of the Child today ?
In my opinion , however , that is not enough , because the archiving of written records is quite simply an essential service .
As far as ASEAN is concerned , the negotiations on the free trade agreement must be seen as an opportunity to ensure that the neighbouring states refrain from implementing any strategy that might offset the sanctions against Burma .
Moreover , any financing of actions to protect the environment may lead to unfair subsidies for big business , without there being any guarantee that they will have a positive impact on the creation of steady full-time jobs , as demonstrated by the current unreliability of environmental studies which must accompany large-scale works .
- Mr President , Commissioner , allow me , too , to express my gratitude to the rapporteur , Mr Kindermann , for his excellent report and to endorse all of his demands .
I would also stress that the work undertaken in constructing OLAF has to be continued .
Mr President , as the last speaker from my group and as coordinator of the group , it falls to me to try and summarise the positions that have been expressed .
To Mahmoud Darwish I say : &apos; Your poem , that has yet to be written , about the children of Gaza , their suffering and their hopes , will be written by a poet from among those children who upheld your spirit , just as you upheld their cause and their little dreams &apos; .
And consequently , what are the next steps we should take ?
Madam President , on a point of order , this is not a criticism of you or the Luxembourg presidency , but of the way we organise the business in this House .
I should like to address special thanks , however , to the Commission for its open and forthcoming cooperation with me and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , which was instrumental in bringing about this very positive outcome .
There are those , like Mr Doorn , who imagine that the Commission does not have to give its opinion on initiatives in this area , because all of that is meant to come under the civil law of the Member States .
Why did the Commission decide to leave the 300 experts in the European task force at home during the tsunami disaster after training and preparing them for years ?
- Mr President , I should like to endorse what Mr Tajani said .
Well , I have looked at the European budget and tried to pick out the entries for initiatives that are specifically concerned with , and of interest to , the elderly and pensioners .
But I think we should accept the Commissioner &apos;s reassurances and continue to support the 10 % biofuels target .
If the summit is to be a success , the EU must take on the role of political leadership and , as the country holding the presidency during the summit , Denmark has a big responsibility for leading the international process in the right direction .
Many of us had therefore been hoping that - not least to dispel the dark and unjust initial coincidence affecting your new term of office - after 40 days of war in Kosovo , Montenegro , Serbia and Voivodina , you would have found the right words today to appeal for an immediate cease-fire and some words of solidarity for all the innocent victims , on all sides , and then made some practical proposals for the reconstruction of the areas destroyed and for an early return of the refugees : the search for a European soul , Mr Prodi , as you once put it in this House .
The Joint Parliamentary Assembly met twice in 2009 .
Firstly , these are small countries which did not start out with a high level of industry but were peripheral nations with a mainly agrarian structure .
Finally , Mr Stefanis , you have heard in this debate that there is a very great consensus for a stricter and clearer approach .
As we have pointed out , rather than security measures we need to tackle the real causes fuelling terrorism .
At the same time , and with regard to the past , it should also be noted that , due to the shortcomings of the Commission &apos; s planning , the timescale for Parliament &apos; s work was exceptionally tight .
Over coming years , we shall indeed see these huge multinationals trying to gain absolute control of the EU market by ousting smaller producers , and this is honestly where we need to pay attention .
This leads to a range of proposals which are set out in the explanatory statement .
My conclusion is , therefore , that lumping all drugs and drugs users together will not provide a solution .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would firstly like to say that I regard the Commission &apos;s budgetary policy as a great achievement and to pay tribute to the competence with which it is implemented .
If extensive studies are carried out of plans and programmes whose impact on the environment is negligible , then this is a waste of energy .
I am very pleased that you , Mr Schulz , brought up the FDP &apos;s idea for a CSCME ( Conference on Security and Cooperation in the Middle East ) , as Kurt Beck has also already done .
We also need pro-family tax solutions and stable employment .
Could the Commissioner tell us which four Member States are not in that situation ?
Indeed , our challenge has been to balance the necessity to help the segments most affected by high oil prices with the need to address long-term structural problems .
Considering that the net cost has been of this order every year , it is staggering just how much of our national resources we have poured into the black hole of Europe .
We are all concerned about health and safety and do not want to see any more accidents on our roads .
We take a very strong line on this , believing that solutions which avoid forcing central banks to outsource the management of their accounts would not be good ones .
Now , however , after the experience we have gained , we can look at this more closely .
&apos; The Commission recalls its commitment towards ensuring that Member States establish correlation tables linking the transposition measures they adopt with the EU directive and communicate them to the Commission in the framework of transposing EU legislation , in the interest of citizens , better-law making and increasing legal transparency and to assist the examination of the conformity of national rules with EU provisions .
- Mr President , in view of the instruments currently at its disposal , I think the Commission reacted appropriately .
The primary purpose and objective of a European security system must be the prevention of military conflicts ; the resolution of conflicts , even by the use of military force if necessary , is a secondary priority .
Mr President , the conclusion of trade negotiations between the European Union and Mexico , considered from a positive perspective , could mean a new and durable framework for the institutionalisation of political dialogue and cooperation , provided that this trade pact works to the benefit of both sides .
The scrapping premium , which 12 Member States have adopted , has ended the freefall , but only on the passenger car market .
It so happens that in the wake of the Industry Council which is due to take place on 7 May , there will be a high-level meeting between Korea and the European Union , and believe you me , we will take stock of the situation there . In fact , over and above the problem of the shipbuilding sector , South Korea and a number of other countries are facing a far more serious crisis , which also affects their industrial structures and massive aid systems .
Currently , VAT rates on food in some Member States are prohibitive and need to be looked at urgently .
The game which the Commission , and especially Mr Lamoureux , as head of DG TREN played with the Council and Parliament over the last weeks is not right .
The Commission accepts Amendment No 8 , which requires better public information on carbon monoxide as an improvement to its proposal .
Nuclear energy must not play a part in this scenario because unresolved safety problems still remain .
There will be 18 new Members from 12 Member States .
Vending machines are also not safe from fraud .
As Mr Corbett bravely pointed out , although governments could have voiced reservations or come forward with different views on matters that were central to the discussion at the Convention , nothing was said .
As the Commission has stated , there has been a lot of progress in the past few years in the EU telecommunications sector , but there is still a lot to be learnt where the mobile phone market is concerned .
However , I regret that the Commission &apos;s proposal does not include a colour-coded labelling system clearly indicating the nutritional value of the product ( low , medium , high ) .
Finally , I would like to say something about Amendment 19 .
Following the agreement last December of an overall EUR 85 billion assistance programme for Ireland , the Irish authorities have undertaken a great deal of work to implement the adjustment programme to which the financial support was attached .
Reading Mrs Veil &apos;s report , we can see how the main problems relating to the free movement of persons are caused not so much by a gap in the legislation but rather by the non-application of the directives and regulations , which are at times obsessively complex .
It is under consideration for the time being .
It is a true reflection of the situation of assisting spouses today .
With regard to the other priorities such as the pursuit of the internal market and the consolidation of growth , our fellow citizens will only adhere to the European ideal if they can see that our social model , the free movement not only of persons , goods and capital , but also of services , and the promotion of education , training and innovation , are reflected in so many tangible improvements in their everyday lives .
The third area is the ratification of the Europol Convention which is currently taking place , under which Europol , the European police force , will at last be able to act .
I quoted many names and countries where we have recently initialled stepping-stone agreements , and we will continue doing so , but our interest is really in finding solutions .
I support the improvements offered by the rapporteur , particularly the transfer of new powers to ESMA which the Commission intended to keep for itself in particular with regard to penalties .
I am not going to put my credit card number on the Internet just like that .
I am happy to talk about the unusual nature of the European structure , but we must avoid having one sauce for the goose and another for the gander .
It is also a good example of the influence Parliament can have .
( SV ) Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to thank the rapporteur for a well-balanced report on a very important subject .
On the one hand , we want to find an efficient way of giving businesses an incentive to substitute viable alternatives for substances of very high concern , but , on the other , we do not want to set up a system that puts chemicals producers within the EU at a competitive disadvantage .
Liberalisation must not of course result in reduced safety for railway users .
It is important not to play into the hands of the terrorists .
It is not possible to send a mission into the field without its having guarantees that it will be able to fulfil its mandate .
Above all , it is necessary to deal with the unregulated legal status of the Arctic region .
Before I finish , I would like to emphasise that I have made a note of what you said today , your commitments for the future .
The reports produced by the WHO indicate that it is fully aware of the alarming infant mortality situation , and it has focused its efforts on improving basic conditions in maternity and general hospitals .
If the EU wants to be an honest broker in the Palestine conflict , it must speak out much more strongly in favour of the two-State solution .
Let me give you a concrete example .
This concerns , in particular , Member States which have had experience of national lists and have abolished them .
To conclude , Mr President , I hope that this Christmas and New Year will give time for reflection to all the ministers who have had concerns about the text that the Commission , with Parliament &apos;s support , presented to the Council .
I congratulate the Commission and OLAF , the anti-fraud office , on the exemplary way they have worked together to bring this about .
We will examine this without prejudice and we are willing to act , but we will of course not go blundering blindly into anything either , because we have to know what the long-term consequences might be .
It can be an economic plan , as we have just heard , but equally a rehabilitation plan that is tackled in a comprehensive way and in which the decentralised instruments play a particularly prominent role .
This is the same Commissioner Reding who , in a pretty crowded field , came up with what may be the single most fatuous argument I have heard from the Commission over the last term when she said that we needed a .eu common domain name in order to make the Internet more accessible to women .
So we are going to continue to point out to the Guatemalan government the need , firstly , to identify the perpetrators of the crime , and then to gradually regain the spirit of the peace agreements , so that such murders are not repeated .
You are responsible because you did not allow a procedure for channelling any financial aid to a government called National Unity to work .
Directing agriculture money elsewhere is an idea that is also supported by some of the leaders of the new Member States , but nobody should be fooled by the pathological compulsion to comply among the post-Communist leaders ; it is no longer from Moscow , but from Brussels that they expect the tap on the shoulder .
The Commission does not claim to be able to solve the freight transport problems facing Europe on its own , but , on that point too , the report by Mrs Ayala Sender sends a message to the Member States to encourage them to develop their own logistics initiatives , especially by investing in infrastructures , in close collaboration with the European Union .
Thirdly , preliminary negotiations are taking place between Turkey and Greece on this type of issue .
Parliament voted for this proposal and wanted all these conventions - particularly the chemical convention - to be ratified .
1998 annual economic report
We have done a calculation of the damage so far to our projects .
And to the others from East Timor , Nigeria , Tibet , whom I did not have a chance to get to know because they were murdered .
I think there is quite a lot more to be said on this subject , which should not be pushed into the background .
Finally , four Member States have not yet signed the convention . They are Austria , Spain , Ireland and Italy .
In order to protect consumers , therefore , we have to establish a body of clear , effective rules and also strengthen cooperation between national consumer protection authorities , by promoting information exchange and providing for the possibility for authorities approached by consumers to request the assistance of an authority from another country .
I should like to address one comment to the Taoiseach . He referred to Old Europe and New Europe .
It is clear that after what happened yesterday the concrete implementation of this measure ought to be discussed anew .
Seriously , what is the European Union doing to oust the Turkish occupying army from Cyprus ?
But I have to tell you that the proposal on honey is chiefly concerned with rules on marketing and labelling these products .
Gross violations are committed daily by those who bend the rules or just disregard them altogether .
It is most gratifying that the rapporteur , the committee and the Council seem to be unanimous on many of the points connected with this issue .
We welcome Parliament &apos;s support for the Commission &apos;s enlargement strategy and its principles , as well as the support for our efforts to enhance communication and transparency .
As I see it , there are three things we need to do if Europe &apos;s supply of natural gas is to be secure in the long term , and I shall now set out what they are .
If we are always going to have such little regard for the competences issue here in the committees and in our day-to-day parliamentary work then I do not think that this bodes well .
In Japan and Russia , there is political will to endorse the statute , but this has still not been embodied in the form of decisions .
How can we find a way , together , of protecting human rights around the world ?
When Europe has rediscovered the reasons for its strong unity , it will have to participate directly , under the aegis of the United Nations , in the construction of the new Iraqi democracy , once it has assisted with the humanitarian needs , the result of a conflict which Saddam Hussein could have avoided by accepting his proposed exile , mentioned several times by Mr Pannella .
It would not even be necessary to draw on the amount allocated in the budget for loan endowments during that financial year , which is to say ECU 338 million in 1998 .
They have had more than 12 hours in which to correct the amendments concerned .
Mr President , I draw three fairly obvious conclusions from the impasse with Russia and Ukraine .
I wish to remind the House that in Article 30 of the Accession Act , which was ratified by the Member States and their national parliaments , express reference is made to Bulgaria &apos;s obligation to close the units by 31.12.2006 .
I believe that we , too , must send out a message of support by abstaining .
We have a duty to react against this generalizing tendency which treats people without papers as illegal , equates immigration and illegality .
It is probably the Saudi peace plan which currently offers the most promising pointers to peace .
Ladies and gentlemen , if we wish to give economic policy its rightful place in Europe , I hope that , in addition to the first strategies that I mentioned just now , but which have not achieved success , we can prove that we are up to the task of making it a reality .
It would impose an obligation on Member States to encourage the use of open application programme interfaces by platform operators and equipment manufacturers .
Obviously that also applies to children under the age of two in aeroplanes .
Without it the part played by renewable energy sources in the energy production of EU Member States would be very low , although the important role played by wind power in Denmark cannot be underestimated .
Unless administrative and legal provisions are harmonized across Europe , there can be no question of reciprocal recognition of disqualification , as the conditions for disqualification vary so widely from one Member State to another .
It was an expression of our diversity of opinion in Europe and of our European democracy , and in a democracy it is ultimately the majority that counts .
How is it possible , I wonder , that we should have purchased this equipment and that during the debate , when we expressed our disapproval of the use of these machines , we were not even told that Parliament had already purchased them ?
Mr Prodi , whilst I may disagree with those views , I have at least to compliment your honesty in saying things in the way that you do .
I refuse to accept that politics should give way upon this issue .
We expect the European Council to call for further efforts to deal with the current situation in the Mediterranean region and to continue the work towards long-term solutions based on solidarity between the Member States .
However , recognition must be had for the diversity of Europe &apos;s maritime areas and decisions must not be taken on the &quot; one-size-fits-all &quot; basis which has come to represent Europe &apos;s failed fisheries policy .
Neither can we grant the right to unlimited travel for patients .
Why is it necessary to revisit the issue again ?
I would like to call on you , in your capacity as President of this Parliament , to demand that the Commission investigate BNFL which has already applied to the British Government to considerably increase discharges from its nuclear operations into the Irish Sea and which would result in over thirty billion litres of effluent being released into the Irish Sea over the next ten years .
Looking at the links between the various presidencies , that was an essential point , and the idea that &apos; enhanced cooperations &apos; will henceforth be included on the agenda for that conference seems absolutely crucial to us .
in writing . - ( SK ) Just like we have medicines for people , we also have medicines for plants : pesticides can justifiably be called that since they are medicines in the fight against diseases , pests and weeds .
The explosion in ethnic violence , the islamisation of many of our towns , and the challenges faced by our social security systems , which cannot cope with these new arrivals , are the most serious consequences of this immigration , which is all the more difficult to assimilate because the immigrants come from cultures alien to our civilisation .
Such forces do not want liberated women equal in all respects to men .
The Commission considers this is not required given that Article 3 already provides that in case of conflict between a specific directive and this proposal it is the former that will prevail .
Leave this to the larger states , which have not been able to resolve it to date .
It is therefore clear why Parliament is urging the Intergovernmental Conference straight out to do justice to the Convention &apos;s result .
So very often help will be given locally by local authorities and measures will most effectively be taken by doctors or the Member States .
It seems to me that today you could pick and choose between different opinions , covering the whole range from zero up to more than we have suggested in our proposal .
These must not be forgotten .
The superlevy must be lowered when the quota is being used but when sales are done with virtually no support to the European Union .
Madam President , Mr Solana , Commissioner , I believe the crisis in Kosovo showed , among other things , that international crisis management cannot be left to NATO alone in the world of the twenty-first century .
But this decision has also a bigger impact .
The next item is the statements of the Council and the Commission on the natural disaster in China .
In this regard , it is important that we do not merely deal with the pleasant things in life , but also with the serious issues , and I hope that , as Parliament , in perhaps a year &apos;s time , we will receive an interim report on how this agreement between the European Union and Georgia has been implemented and , above all , how well it has worked .
We might consider establishing performance bonuses for the EU strategy on the Roma minority , within the framework of the cohesion policy .
We are on the right road here , in particular , when it comes to incorporating the costs of congestion into overall road costs .
I would like to make it very clear that we , through the fourth supplementary and amending budget , were spontaneously and quickly in a position to increase the appropriate resources and to make said resources available .
A process that must be characterised by openness and transparency .
This adjective was used by Montaigne in 1580 to describe something that was difficult to define .
The proposals regarding VAT are not bold enough .
It is difficult to support international relations , such as those defined in the reports voted on by Parliament , with a country that does not respect agreements and which , above all , takes a stand on the fundamental right to the protection of life .
It is difficult to support international relations , such as those defined in the reports voted on by Parliament , with a country that does not respect agreements and which , above all , takes a stand on the fundamental right to the protection of life .
It is difficult to support international relations , such as those defined in the reports voted on by Parliament , with a country that does not respect agreements and which , above all , takes a stand on the fundamental right to the protection of life .
This is despite that fact that the Dalai Lama has long since given up the objective not just of Tibetan independence , but also Tibetan sovereignty .
Rather than seeing such an extremely unhealthy separation between the decision-makers and those who are paying , our group would prefer us to move towards a total renationalisation of the CAP that would enable the Member States to draw up their own agricultural policy to the benefit of their farmers , rural land-use planning and consumer protection .
It is for example very positive that we now have colleges of supervisors handling big , multi-jurisdiction , pan-European cases , but sometimes these colleges lack authority ; they do not have enough resources ; they do not take enough majority decisions , for example , so it would be very good if we could consider more qualified majority voting in Level 3 committees as well as in the colleges of supervisors .
Why is it that we have to attack the United States when what they appear to be doing is retaining consumer confidence in food there , in the way that we should be here in Europe ?
Mr President , I would like firstly to join with all those who have congratulated Mr Muscat on his report on consolidation in financial services and particularly on his proposal to create a committee of &quot; wise men &quot; .
There is discrimination against elderly people and people with disabilities , who are given - or not given - financial support just because they are over , or under , 65 years old .
It is up to the communication media whether or not to use this material .
Since , in this case , transport costs are high , a system will have to be introduced which will need to be very much decentralised , because transporting an end-of-life vehicle over a distance of more than 100 km is not a profitable activity .
( The Parliament adopts the resolution )
During the election campaign , my party demanded mandatory registration of lobbyists on a register that is common to all EU institutions .
I would very much like to see mobility , not only of persons but of goods and services too .
At the same time we must identify the drawbacks that also exist in the case of renewables .
Indeed , it is unacceptable that , at the same time as it is applying to join the European Union , not only does Turkey not recognise a Member State like Cyprus but it even keeps thousands of troops on Cypriot soil .
First of all , the Commission fully agrees that one of the main arguments used to convince the EU &apos;s citizens of the benefits of the single currency was the fact that the introduction of the euro would bring down costs for tourists and for businesses trading across borders .
The euro is not the reason for the crisis , as the Commissioner usually quite rightly points out .
Where they make economic , environmental and energy sense , I will support them , when they merely maintain agricultural expenditure at the expense of common sense , I will not .
I consider that , in areas such as this , different EU countries should be allowed to have different rules - more liberal or more restrictive - depending on the wishes of the voters .
It is considered that such missions would be a waste of valuable resources at this moment as 100 % testing is in place for poultrymeat from Brazil and Thailand and for shrimps from Thailand .
We express our great disgust and indignation that the ethnic cleansing and destruction of hundreds of Medieval Orthodox churches in Metochia , Kosovo , have taken place before the eyes of the international security forces of NATO and the United Nations .
I noted the high level of involvement of schools in educational programmes with a series of interdisciplinary activities . And I saw absolutely no evidence pointing to an absence of associationism .
Although such a balance will be difficult , it is often an attainable target , as evidenced by this compromise .
That is the message that we have sent out with a massive majority of the House today , and it is a hefty shot across the bows of those governments which are blocking progress here .
It is detrimental to cooperation in the spirit of Cotonou that the proposal of Sudan was adopted by the ACP states .
The second industry affected is that of poultry , sheep and cattle farming .
This is absolutely vital since , if the policies that we are debating and that we have been working on for months and years are to be genuinely effective , then this will , this dynamic that we want , must not be thwarted by any discouraging administrative aspects .
These countries are being let down somewhat , with a sum of EUR 50 billion being mentioned .
So this proposal to incorporate environmental aspects more firmly in the reform is certainly in the interests of agriculture and of jobs .
We also know that there is illegal cultivation and trafficking of opium , which accounts for 40 % of Afghanistan &apos;s gross domestic product .
The prior authorisation system is necessary : without it , many Member States could have difficulties controlling the costs of their own healthcare system and planning and assessing the future .
I fear , above all , an internal rift about the attitude with regard to America &apos;s role in the world , and hence about how to tackle the major breeding grounds of conflict .
The Commission favours a deepening and broadening of the partnership to embrace all those involved in the social and economic spheres .
Compared with the previous five-year period , Commissioner , the increase in the aid granted by the Union is in fact very low , accounting for only a few percentage points .
One of those areas is agricultural policy , which has to be adapted to a more efficient market , otherwise the prices would be far too high for consumers in those countries and place an unbearable weight on the Union &apos;s budget .
The crucial issue is not taking measures to facilitate movement merely for the sake of taking them .
Where Laeken is concerned , my group is pleased that the declaration was so ambitious .
If the Council does react like this , nothing will have been gained from the crisis and it will have negative consequences for the future of the European Union , which would be particularly unfortunate given the crucial stage we are currently at .
We must find out whether other animals in our food chain are equally at risk , because a few days ago pigs were said to be amongst the animals most vulnerable to this type of virus .
Some have been able to use their role in the supply of energy to buy themselves powerful foreign friends .
To do this Parliament requires a continuous and unreserved flow of information , primarily from the Commission , even though some officials may have acted in a negligent or culpable manner .
I would also like to mention a project from the DAPHNE programme , that being the European Year against Violence against Women .
I clearly do not have time to go into them in detail .
The Constitution must be revised , with its component parts kept separate from specific policies .
My starting point is simply this .
It is important to pursue the principles and objectives set out in the July communication .
In this connection , Mr President , I think it is worth mentioning that , even in this institution , far more zeal than usual is displayed in asking one of our German colleagues for her card . It so happens that the lady is of Kurdish descent , with a dark complexion and black eyes and therefore does not look like the average Member .
By being so , we are committing ourselves to joining with civil society in Turkey in ensuring that Turkey becomes a country free of every kind of torture .
I believe in our success if , and only if , we manage to use political means .
Consumer protection , in particular protection of children , who are the most vulnerable group , is a priority for the European Parliament .
For the 2005 financial year , we can conclude that the agencies were by and large well managed .
Let us not therefore turn this debate into an attempt the square the circle : we must achieve more growth and the reforms are an essential element , we will have to decide what must be reformed and how it must be reformed , but there is no question that we need reforms , that we need to improve the functioning of the market in goods and the labour market , to improve the quality of public accounts and to incorporate more research , development , innovation and knowledge into public actions .
It is tragic that it has been debauched and disfigured over many years by a series of military coups .
Accordingly , this agreement is of great political importance .
That means continuing to create a monopoly system dominated by the agribusiness multinationals .
I speak on behalf of the entire Socialist Group in the European Parliament and fortunately also on behalf of the vast majority who made their views clear through the vote in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety .
We need to favour fuels and technologies with low or zero emissions .
I find it regrettable in fact that , today , the European Commission should give in to any old objection from any old Member State .
The objectives of the agencies are defined in the Financial Regulation which , as you know , is published in the Official Journal .
Mr President , the postal market is in the process of being liberalised at European level and also at national level .
In addition , as Mr Nassauer pointed out , in the transitory period , national parliamentary control will disappear , but without our Parliament &apos;s control coming into effect , and on that point we join Mr Nassauer in his request for information .
( EL ) Mr President , is it really necessary that we use rapid border intervention teams with state-of-the-art equipment , who have the right to make arrests , bear arms , have the right to use their weapons in the name of self-defence , use violence and act like special forces with advanced technological equipment , that is act as a military force , in order to deal with ragged immigrants or save those battling the seas in an attempt to find a better life ?
Mr President , nowadays we are faced with a paradox .
We shall see that a great deal more is possible than the industrial community itself would have thought .
Since then , the Commission has been investigating the subject , and we are highlighting here the large range of questions needing to be answered .
Less than half voted in last year &apos;s European elections .
Improving the control arrangements in the Member States is central to ensuring the correct use of Union funds .
The recent disaster in the Gulf of Mexico , which has caused millions of barrels of oil to be discharged into the sea , has drawn the world &apos;s attention to a subject that is fundamental for the European Union .
So the Council feels that on that list , agreed on that day , it got a once and for all exemption .
On 1 April 2008 - next year - another 0.5 % will be added to the increase in the quota allocated to 11 Member States .
That is exactly what we are trying to do now , in other words to stress the economic aspects of the problem so that the political decisions will be correctly based and we will not need to have retractions which , as we all understand , are exceptionally damaging to the European Union &apos;s credibility .
We will follow up on the Green Paper on labour law .
Essentially , we need to understand that preserving and protecting the environment requires action at both global and local level .
It is no good if today , you continue to put forward these arguments .
The proposal you are putting forward does not guarantee that .
But let me point out that air safety in the Community depends on cooperation between the national authorities , international organisations and the industry .
- Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , I warmly congratulate you .
Mr President , my party , the UK Independence Party , constantly criticises the European Union , so it makes a pleasant change for me at least partially to be able to support the Commission &apos;s decision to suspend funding to the Palestinian Authority .
Mr President , I shall convey the messages I have heard here to my colleagues in the Council .
Despite these shortcomings , I should like to express my interest in the new European Commission initiatives under the &apos; external influence &apos; heading .
With regard to this report , we do not agree with the rapporteur or with the committee outcome in several regards .
Another key aspect is job losses .
This reflects in part the fact that the historically low level of interest rates in the euro area continues to support monetary expansion .
In addition to other aspects , particularly cultural ones , there are therefore bases on which progress can be made towards Turkey &apos; s future membership of the European Union .
I support this report .
We all recognise that the European Union , in spite of economic recovery , is still working well below par for too many people ; specifically for 15 million of our fellow citizens the EU is simply not working at all .
This is precisely what we have set out in CARS 21 , namely a long-term , stable and predictable regulatory framework .
As we see it , it is a matter of regulating a different form of admittance in response to values - that is , family protection - and a strategic political objective : the promotion of the integration of third-country nationals who are already living lawfully in the Union into their host societies .
When I talk about negotiations , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , I am referring to negotiations with Parliament .
Mr President , we have made a great deal of progress since the launch of the REACH project .
It is absolute nonsense to waive their visa requirement on the grounds that they would otherwise be trapped in their pitiful little countries .
My point is that when we decide the direction of Europe - and that is what the coming months have to be about ; when we have the debate about how Europe copes with these great challenges , we should always keep our minds focused on the daily concerns of the people we represent .
This also applies in my view to state aid in the form of tax concessions .
These are all essential issues .
We are at the dawn of a reform of several COMs and the Commission &apos;s proposals for regulations worry us a great deal .
Please do not tell us that it is the College that will decide .
It is at least heartening that this House is united .
In all these talks he deprecated all forms of violence and pressed for human rights to be upheld .
This would involve ignoring the fact that ten Member States have already ratified it and that the no votes in two States , although they express a negative position with regard to the Constitution , nonetheless do not constitute support for an alternative project and also include some contradictions .
I submitted a great number of amendments in French and signed them myself .
Firstly , the Member of the Council which still only wants partial market opening - and we know exactly which one this is - is in contravention of the Treaties .
Furthermore , these amendments are intended to introduce a system of dual authorisation of works on the Internet , one for hosting and one for caching , which would be a heavy burden for the network management .
Publicity is an efficient tool for combatting excess bureaucracy .
It should not be a dry , boring museum , but a place where our memory of European history and the work of European unification is jointly cultivated , and which at the same time is available as a locus for the European identity to go on being shaped by present and future citizens of the European Union .
I think these are the two first steps upon which the process of negotiation should be based .
On behalf of my group , the Socialist Group , I profoundly regret the failure of the peaceful approach and I hope that there is no mass destruction of the civilian population , bringing a trail of death and destruction to a population a half of which is under fifteen years old .
We have the same goals , namely to protect the environment by establishing minimum standards for the sanctioning of environmental offences and to try to eliminate the possibility of safe havens for environmental offenders in the European Union .
Serbia &apos;s future obviously lies in Europe and its cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia should demonstrate Belgrade &apos;s commitment to European values , democracy and human rights .
I think that it would be right for us , in this very House , to pay particular attention to the wording of this warning , which calls on us to work harder to strengthen the peace efforts in this region and , if necessary , take a tougher stance in bringing Israel to the negotiating table and ensuring peace , not only in the region , but also in the state of Israel and for its citizens .
We will begin the final part of Question Time .
In that case , what would happen if the majority of people in a single Member State voted &apos; no &apos; ?
It is finally worth mentioning that smaller Member States , such as Belgium and Ireland , already implement such tests .
Culture 2000 could certainly be criticised for lack of transparency , difficulties over selection , in short , for everything related to method .
Although this report fortunately does not go that far , there is a casual reference to the assessment of children .
Such an environment does not cultivate consumer confidence , domestic demand or domestic growth .
Furthermore , I would like to thank the Commission for being willing to reconsider its proposals and for the commitment there was to harmonise a text , which is certainly not easy , to make it satisfactory in view of all the respective points of view .
I am totally aware of the problems that all this has caused for British farmers .
First of all , the PPE Group welcomes the decision of the European Commission to make a clear distinction between electronic signatures and encryption , and to clearly decouple these from each other .
As half a million EU citizens die needlessly each year from smoking yet 80 % of smokers want to give up , I hope that colleagues will see fit to sign the tabled written declaration calling for an EU no smoking day .
The virtuous union of the declaration of fundamental rights and that of the Council of Europe , which relates to the same subject , will therefore create a solution that , by combining these two sources of law , will enable the European Court of Justice to ensure that , on this point as on others , praetorian law will have demonstrated that it is sometimes ahead of the reality that is shaped by those who want more Europe and those who , unfortunately , want less .
As a Parliament we then called on the Commission to improve its infringement procedures and its dealings with complainants , calling in particular for correspondence passing between the Commission and the Member States to be made available .
We are still a long way from the situation in the United States , a much more integrated federation than our own , where there is a significant federal budget , where there are rules for coordinating the budgets of the federal states , where budgetary policy and monetary policy are closely coordinated by Congress , where Congress is able to influence the options taken by the Chairman of the Federal Reserve and where the Federal Reserve &apos;s objectives are wider than mere price stability .
I hope that the solidarity that was shown in the Committee on Transport and Tourism will still be there tomorrow during the vote .
What action are we going to take ?
We have to give consideration to loading and unloading as has been stated .
In conclusion , I would ask the Commission to seriously examine the role of Local Authorities in promoting cultural programmes .
The main problem regarding the use of Structural Funds did come up , which is primarily an issue in Eastern Europe .
Mr Barroso also repeatedly argued for a new wave of mass immigration and constantly played down the problems associated with the possible accession of Turkey to the EU .
International Tropical Timber Agreement 2006 - International Tropical Timber Agreement 2006 ( debate )
Mr President , my predecessor , Mr Philip Whitehead MEP , would have been proud to have spoken on behalf of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection .
That is why substances which destroy the ozone layer need to be replaced with alternative substances as quickly as possible .
My second concern relates to the coordination of economic policies : the process provided for in the Treaty does not seem to give particularly spectacular results . I am , above all , concerned about continuing efforts with regard to the consolidation of budgetary stabilization .
As Mr Barroso said earlier , the Commission has today taken a decision on the first measures that we are to be responsible for , namely the citizens &apos; initiative .
The Legal Service points out that Article 11 of the Directive says that Member States &quot; may &quot; restrict equal treatment for third-country nationals in certain cases .
I hope it will be a light-touch framework , but we need to drive it through quickly because the e-clock is ticking and there are many organisations around the world fighting for this business .
On 24 June , the coordinators of the Committee on the Environment did in fact discuss the Commission &apos;s decision on the sale of genetically modified maize , but the proposal has not been examined in committee .
From a political point of view , the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs had already adopted , by a large majority , the introduction of both biometric identifiers , with the sole difference that it left the adoption of the second to the Member States &quot; discretion .
The importance of these companies in the EU is also highlighted by the fact that , firstly , they react quickly to market developments and are thus particularly useful in promoting new technologies , and , secondly , they can concentrate on economic niches and thus increase Europe &apos;s competitiveness by creating highly-skilled technology-related jobs .
We do not say this about the steel industry or the car industry .
They are responsible for a delay of five months at most .
We shall see how this develops .
In order to push this directive through quickly , we are supporting the rapporteur .
I would like to assure those who will not be voting for me that I shall display the same sense of fair play that I have shown about Greece &apos;s victory in Euro 2004 .
In the context of the crisis into which Hariri &apos;s assassination risks plunging the country , UN Resolution 1559 , which initially was backed by one European country and the US , is taking on a completely new dimension .
This implies that the profit of a multinational is more important than the interest of the people .
I believe they should withdraw it .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , after all this criticism I am going to take up the cudgels on behalf of the Schengen Agreements .
I shall therefore say once again that the Occhetto decision will be an historic decision in the history of Parliament , in the history of the affirmation of the personality of Parliament and of the rights of MEPs .
We also think that the Cancun ministerial conference ought to decide to deepen the discussions on voluntary labelling for environmental purposes .
Supervising a system that does not work will not enable us to avoid its worst aberrations .
This will present another opportunity to continue this dialogue .
Another example is the fact that an accelerated procedure will also not be possible if subsequent applications are made without any relevant new content .
And yet the best you can come up with is to suggest asking these multinationals to set up ethical investment committees .
We know that the cause of this is some financial instability coming from the other side of the Atlantic .
I think we really need to insist that the heads of government get a little more out of their finance ministers , because education is a field where work needs to be both extended and intensified .
Given these circumstances , I am satisfied with the outcome of the meeting .
It is important to find a balance in this respect .
In answer to the question , I would like to say that the Commission was asked by the relevant Ukrainian organizations to provide partial funding by means of a Euratom loan for the completion of these two reactors .
It is important that new functional blocks be implemented following consultation of all the relevant parties , and Member States take effective actions in order to achieve an integrated management system .
Among other things , I want to point out the position expressed with force by the Audit Office yesterday , on the fact that while the VAT system based on the principle of the country of destination and not of origin remains in force , there will be a considerable risk of fraud .
With regard to research , the European Commission has , for many years , given its support to the field of biomedicine .
Mr President , Mr Solana , Commissioner Patten , ladies and gentlemen , if we are to decide between war and peace , we must conduct our debate with the greatest seriousness , but also with confidence in ourselves .
However , within the EU itself , farmers and processing businesses lost interest in this sector .
This is the case in particular for access to documents in infringement procedures .
Here we can either go in through direct activities which are clearly linked to that , such as state aid , tax incentives , intellectual property rights , regulations , standardisation , lead market initiatives , public procurement , risk venture capital , and so on .
The majority of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats is absolutely not rejoicing at the prospect of these two initiatives .
To my mind , it is a very serious problem when I see , for instance , that newspapers in Ethiopia , which are naturally controlled by the government , are even now reporting continuously on the amounts of money they have already amassed for the next &apos; election campaign &apos; .
That is the main purpose of this oral question : to encourage the Commission to examine in practical terms the various points listed in the draft resolution in order to give an opinion on the feasibility and timeliness of such a tax .
It is silly to confuse the issue . There is no point in trying to put everything under one roof .
All the major European gay rights groups are involved in this programme .
This situation has repercussions for all the countries of the European Union since , as everyone knows , a migrant whose papers have been put in order may move freely within a large part of the EU &apos;s territory .
More than 330.000 people in Latvia remain without status .
I would like to just say that the agreement includes a commitment to simplify the registration procedures , with a view to ensuring equal treatment for EU and Russian citizens , and I would like to remind you that the Schengen acquis also imposes a general obligation for aliens to register .
Forcing civil aviation operators and the largest among them , the companies running airports and the airlines , not only to comply with long-standing security measures but also to bear the costs of these themselves would be a straightforward matter .
I feel that this innovation - and I am addressing Mr Haarder here - is extremely significant , for we are still , to some extent , suffering from a problem of relations with the Council which is having extremely negative effects .
I should like to say how much I agree with Mr Libicki : the regulatory framework still needs scrutinising , which is why this report , to my regret , will be unable to have the effect that it really needs .
We know what has to happen .
In the Netherlands , people wanted to introduce the Euro 5 standards early , but the Commission would not allow this , stating that this could distort the internal market .
This will focus on such areas as transport , economic development and environmental protection .
It was a European Parliament proposal that originally advocated that doubtful cases should be labelled .
Freedom of speech and freedom of assembly and association are preconditions for the development of modern societies .
It will be more powerful still under the Lisbon Treaty , if and when it is eventually ratified .
It is reasonable for both the Commission and Parliament to place on view the administrative expenditure due to enlargement under Section V of the budget .
But that has to be re-emphasised , because we have heard the opposite message again today .
The report is exhaustive and explores in detail those numerous factors that affect competitiveness in the forestry industry , both the tangible and the intangible .
Secondly , an extensive programme of scholarships should be set up for Belarussian young people and students who wish to study in one of the EU Member States , as well as a programme to support universities willing to accept them .
It is something in addition to the Stability Pact .
You had to guide me through some difficult decisions .
Madam President , Mrs Lynne mentioned the word &apos; strong &apos; .
When preparing for this debate , I looked again at what exactly was contained in our TACIS programmes with Russia . As Mr Santer told you , some ECU 2 billion have been earmarked under these in recent years since 1991 .
I would like to know how lists relating to the 2002 secretarial assistance allowances can end up in the hands of journalists and what conclusions you draw from this .
Maintaining the cohesion fund will , in my opinion , promote the continued extension of Europe &apos;s infrastructure , even under the difficult conditions imposed by the stability pact .
I would like to again express our dismay and our grief over the victims and express our sympathy to their families .
Regarding recoveries in direct management , the Commission thanks the rapporteur for his support in the current revision of financial regulation which we have already placed on the table , in particular the proposals aiming to establish a uniform time limit of five years , and of course the level of privilege for Community entitlement to fiscal claims in national law which , to our regret , the Council was reluctant to support .
This tragedy has evoked great sympathy , and in so doing has also started the discussion we are currently witnessing in Europe on the future of nuclear energy and Europe &apos;s energy strategy .
It is precisely for those reasons , however , that we believe that Parliament has to take a stand , Mr President , in the first instance by means of a resolution .
We have had a lot of difficulties with this report , on the whole question of how much money we should go for and over what period of time , and what the role of the taskforces should be .
On the other hand , I think it is wrong to include in the priorities a number of youth , education and culture programmes , which are all areas where European policy should not encroach on the Member States &apos; responsibilities .
I should also like to re-emphasise what I said before about the Falun Gong .
What is the reason for this delay ?
They must be informed and the governments must be informed , because we are dealing here in with certain large commercial concerns which have no interest whatsoever in the use of renewable energies and will therefore do everything they possibly can to stifle it .
The first one was the Flemish Parliament around four years ago .
Furthermore , from the environmental point of view , it must be reflected in the commitment to recovering the spirit that made Europe the leader in the commitment to environmental sustainability and preventing climate change at the Copenhagen conference and , above all , to acknowledging that deeply disappointing taste in the mouth with which we left the Copenhagen conference .
Mr President , the establishment of the Community support framework for Community structural assistance for the whole of Greece as an Objective 1 area will be an important tool for Greece in its efforts towards economic and social development and will provide it with support on the road to economic and monetary union and help it to assume the role that it can and must play throughout the Balkans and the south-eastern Mediterranean basin .
That failure is derived from certain economic laws which apply also to the narcotics sector .
A total of 35 % renewable energy in nine years !
The Commission has already opened a wide debate on this energy vector which will allow us to use forms of transport without emissions .
Nor can we back general formulations aimed at reducing the taxation of work in order to promote employment or adjust the excise duties .
Montenegro is at the start of a journey which will neither be easy nor simple , but it has a prospect of accession and a road map , and it can benefit from the experience of the countries in the region which have completed the path of accession not very long ago .
The rapporteur seeks to ensure a common minimum level of protection including the reversal of the burden of proof in civil race discrimination cases and giving individuals the right to take civil proceedings if they are harassed or victimised on the grounds of race .
We could invite Morgan Tsvangirai to come to a meeting of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Development in July or September .
From this point of view , we should also reiterate the European Union , in the conclusions of the General Affairs Council meetings of 8 and 9 October 2001 , reaffirms its commitment to non-proliferation and disarmament .
This resolution contains many sound points , but its basis , in Article 1 , is that the murder was a political one organised by the IRA .
Thirdly , we also need what I would like to call a &apos; pioneering spirit &apos; , which would show Europe the way forward .
We have three people in the Commission who have the right to give an opinion , but the positions of the Commission are the positions expressed by the President on behalf of the college and by the relevant Commissioner .
Minister , once again , if it is not too difficult , I would like to ask whether the drafting of the anti-discrimination directive has moved forward at least a little and how negotiations , discussions and consultations with the Member States on speeding up the anti-discrimination directive are progressing because it is very important for people with disabilities .
It has clearly demonstrated , if there were any doubt , how much the opinions and views of the many Members differ with regard to the negotiations on Turkey &apos;s accession to the European Union .
However , this method is the only way for the nomination and future appointment of the Commission to correspond to a genuine agreement - as specified in the Amsterdam Treaty - between the Council of Ministers and the Parliament directly elected by the people .
It is our duty to bring about the definitive , irreversible advance of democracy , human rights and cross-frontier cooperation throughout Europe .
The European Union showed a strong and unified position during the talks and the Belgian presidency did a good job in coordinating our position .
In the prices package these past two years , I myself presented a proposal aimed to renew the regulation on replanting and grubbing up .
An exception could possibly be made for those who can demonstrate that they were required to leave on Sunday on account of the remoteness of their homes , if , for example , they live in Finland or Greece .
However , I personally believe that we must avoid imposing prescriptive requirements on developing countries to liberalise services .
We are also , however , saying just as clear a yes to the task of developing and promoting commercial television companies in Europe so that they can compete effectively worldwide .
in writing . ( PL ) I voted in favour of the report by Mrs Frassoni on monitoring the application of Community law ( 2005 ) .
Madam President , I too regard it as a notable success of the European Union &apos;s recent initiative that the majority and the opposition have accepted the path proposed to them , the path of agreement , of national reconciliation in two important points : a more united government and the announcement of new elections .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the best thing to do concerning our trade relations with China and Asian markets in general is to desist from an unequal contest that will cause irreparable damage to European industry : the textile industry today , manufacturing tomorrow , then the car industry , technology and so on .
In recent times , in relation to the problem of overlapping of frequencies , we have now fully resolved - in a way which is satisfactory to both parties - the overlapping of code M of the American GPS - which is the maximum security code - with our own signal - the closed security signal , reserved for public authorities within the Galileo system - and we have found formulae which have in no way prejudiced the quality of the Galileo system and which at the same time offer the security guarantees called for by the United States .
That is why , in one of my amendments adopted in committee , I called for an EU code of good practice on health care-acquired infections , and for the screening of all health care workers to be encouraged across the EU .
This report , while it may not appear very important in the overall context of this Parliament , seems to me likely to bring about real Community action .
I believe that the resolution before us represents that sensible settlement .
Secondly , we need to consider the need for innovation in administration , in other words , innovation in the management of innovation . This is because the market guides innovation , and administration is not used to following the market , which works much faster .
I believe this is a matter of the utmost urgency , and if something is not done about it soon , then something will certainly happen .
The competition rules of the EC Treaty apply only for economic activities in connection with sport ; they do not of course apply for genuine sporting activities .
If there is no international agreement , they risk relocating outside Europe , with the result that worldwide greenhouse gas emissions ( carbon leakage ) will increase .
Perhaps we could simply all try it together once more , Mr President .
I am glad to support this report by my colleague , Mr Collins .
I fully agree with Mr Rehn and Mr Nicolaï , who I feel have expressed very objective opinions .
( DE ) Commissioner , I would be interested to know how much these functionaries are costing .
The distances over which animals are transported are growing .
We think that this picture of ours is confirmed by the examination carried out by the Court of Auditors .
In addition , a wide range of affected sectors in Europe have a formal relationship with the Commission in this regard through EFRAG , the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group , which has been established for this purpose .
I would have thought that sixty-five would be right , for we should demand of ourselves what we demand , at the present time , of society as a whole , without getting special treatment .
As corporate social responsibility is based mainly on decisions taken by companies on a voluntary basis , I believe that the imposition of any kind of additional duties and administrative requirements would most probably prove counterproductive .
I am sure that the Italian Presidency will do its utmost to keep this region at the top of the Union &apos;s priorities .
Surely it is often the mechanisms themselves that provoke criminal behaviour and generate corruption : it is the barriers placed between commercial or economic operators and the pursuit of their business that opens the door to corruption .
I would like to point out , because I believe it is significant , that yesterday saw the close of the Summit of the Americas - not in the best possible circumstances - and to say to the Presidency-in-Office that a very important area is being opened up allowing the European Union decisively to make this a priority for the next European Union / Latin America Summit of Heads of State or Government , in Mexico .
I think it is important not to invest exclusively in the area of technology , either , which is an important area .
In my view , nothing like that will ever happen again , thanks to the existence of digital libraries .
There are three factors here .
Let us not fool ourselves , let us not use rhetoric .
This question can be broken down into other questions : what type of European Union do they want ?
Mr President , I would also like to conclude by thanking the Commission and in particular Commissioner Liikanen and his colleagues for their efforts , which have made a decisive contribution to this overall agreement .
I would dearly like , Commissioner , to see the track-changes text in relation to proposals 29 and 30 ; it would be intriguing , I think , to see who is responsible for the changes and the very special language used there .
That is the question of career structure and your proposals to move to a linear career structure .
I have to say I disagree with Commissioner Patten in relation to the trade agreements .
As Rapporteur on EU - ETS , I am only too aware of the steps we need to take to combat climate change ; the combined harmonization and reduction of emissions proposed in the report are issues I fully support .
This is an issue , Mr President , which is included in the European Union &apos;s Charter of Fundamental Rights , which states that linguistic diversity and all cultures will be defended .
This applies to both new and old economies as well .
These and other issues are still being examined in the course of the ongoing process of Treaty reform .
In addition , this measure will also help reduce Europe &apos;s energy dependency , which is a priority in light of the recent energy crisis Europe experienced .
With regard to CO2 , the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection has suggested that the European Commission submit a legislative proposal to reduce the rolling resistance of tyres by 5 % .
Therefore , Commissioner , we urge the European Commission to send a letter in this regard to the relevant governments , those of Austria and Switzerland , as Mrs Wortmann-Kool has just rightly stated .
In particular , I welcome the clear statement that we must aim for automatic exchange of information to become the general rule .
First , a guarantee of high , legally binding reduction targets which will put the world on the right track to solving the climate problems .
This will prevent differing treatment within a single family .
I should like you , Madam President , to express to the Council our wish that they be present at such votes in future .
I therefore welcome all the reforms that have been announced to transform the Commission in Geneva into a restricted council on human rights .
Health care and care for the elderly are issues that have traditionally occupied prominent places on our Liberal agenda .
Do you accept that it is making genuine efforts in that regard ?
Yes , Mr Posselt , I take note of your comment , and I congratulate the brave people who are here this morning .
- Madam President , the Programme for Action against HIV / AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis dates back to 2001 and has now been in force for two years .
Trade benefits both parties and so do the international fisheries agreements .
Mr President , this report is intended as a contribution to the revision of the Treaties and as a contribution to a European constitution .
I hope that the French Presidency will never accept such mockery of the Kyoto Protocol and negative discrimination against the new Member States , including my homeland .
These would be the issues of the next debate , for which sufficient time should be allowed .
. - Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I had hoped that Mr Fava would not mention today &apos;s news from Italy , but , seeing that he has , in my capacity as an Italian Member of this Parliament , and not as the coordinator of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , I would like to say that today Osama Bin Laden must be laughing his head off because , in my country , instead of arresting terrorists , they concentrate on arresting their captors .
We are aware of the extent to which you defend this value that is indispensable for our democracy and our institution , and so , I shall give you the floor , an hour later than planned , unfortunately , to allow you to give us the communication on the partnership with the United Nations in the areas of development and humanitarian issues .
Would you please look into this ?
Eighty short-term observers from the EU and eighty-five bilaterally from Member States will be deployed throughout the whole of Cambodia .
Vice-President of the Commission . - ( DE ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I had already noted that , Mr Rübig .
The conditions and parameters in place in the individual regional labour markets are so disparate that a European approach will not enable us to increase prosperity for citizens ; instead , we would be entrenching poverty , unemployment and black-market work .
With regard to the sectoral amendments , I am delighted that the Committee on Agriculture has taken up my proposal with regard to the authorization of &quot; new plantations &apos; for high-quality wines produced in specific regions .
We have to protect our citizens from unnecessary noise .
While on the subject , I do see a small ray of hope in my own country , Germany .
( GA ) Mr President , I should like to support the call in the report for society to address the problems of alcohol abuse .
By no means all the Member States have yet begun to address this problem .
How can this be combined with the liberalisation or maintenance of the quota system ?
The ever-increasing interdependence between internal and external security is becoming clear .
It is clear that our approach to employment must cover macro-economic , as well as micro-economic , policies and must address problems which arise not just in labour markets but also in the product and capital markets .
The economic situation nevertheless offers some glimmers of hope .
We note the concerns that have been expressed with regard to the WTO panel on the EU &apos;s seals ban and on Canadian oil sands .
I have not had any reply from you , although the President at the time assured me she would look into the matter .
In the opinion of the rapporteur , Mrs Berès , we need to provide the Member States with policy advice without , however , interfering too much in national policy , and to supply guidelines so that the interested parties can all work to the same plan .
Luckily , however , the institutions began to see eye to eye last autumn and Parliament has been able to discuss the current version .
More resources are needed on the other hand for research , development and practical projects which support renewable energy sources such as bio-energy , solar cells , wind energy , biofuels , energy-saving products and processes and new energy-efficient and environmentally friendly fuels such as ethanol , methanol , hydrogen gas , rape oil etc . In this connection , Mr President , the white paper must be considerably amended .
I also welcome this report by Mr Chanterie .
The action plan will then include a mechanism that not only Mr Cavada in his question but also , I think , many Member States would like to see : a mechanism for evaluating and monitoring the implementation of the action plan measures .
Some Member States have that and others might not have it , but the fact is that in the new constitution , the government of Hungary has abolished this symbolic Ombudsman .
That is the message our leaders will doubtless seek to convey at the upcoming June summit .
The relevant Council departments have checked and approved the participation of Members of the European Parliament in this Conference , and I am pleased that Members will indeed be taking part in this Conference .
Energy conservation therefore makes it even easier for us to raise our climate target a little .
We should also direct our assistance to renewable sources of energy in developing countries ( of course fighting hunger is the most important , but I am talking here about additional funds ) , as well as for overcoming the direct effects of global warming , for adaptation measures associated for example with coastal flooding , soil salinisation and a level of floods and droughts that was previously unknown .
In my opinion , domestic work is household production and should form a significant part in statistics relating to the economic output of a country .
The prolongation of a patent by six months is yet another gift to the pharmaceutical multinationals , in total disregard of the health of children and running counter to the objectives of this very regulation .
No one can fall back on the excuse that &apos; we knew nothing &apos; .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , obviously the Commission is continuing to be very concerned over the current situation in Burundi and once again it must deplore events there , especially the recent assassination of the Archbishop of Gitega .
However , the people of Belarus know little of our concern for their situation , their life .
It is sad that harassment , intimidation and arrests are used as a means of suppressing the diversity of civil society .
Just as protecting biodiversity is and must be a central value in our current societies , the protection of linguistic diversity must be seen as a central element of progress , the promotion of peace and development .
First of all , I would like to say to the honourable Members that in the view of the Commission , the EURODAC Regulation is instrumental to the implementation of the Dublin Convention which determines which Member State is responsible for considering an asylum application lodged in one of the Member States .
Well , Korean agricultural tariffs are going to come down by 75 % over the first seven years of this agreement ; we wanted our geographical indicators protected , our Whisky , our Champagnes , our wines , our hams and so on are going to be protected in Korea as a result of this agreement .
The Commission also explained this morning that it clearly endorses a compulsory system .
We all know what a difficult area EU tax coordination is .
The debates on cases of breaches of human rights , democracy and the rule of law are closed .
The Commission accepts Amendments Nos 8 to 34 .
It falls within the Community &apos;s competence least of all when military matters are involved , as in the present case .
I therefore want to go there , talk about human rights and defend them .
This agreement is a good example of the power of the multinationals and the role of the World Trade Organisation as a forum that defends their interests .
In many towns , we have not only insulated buildings , but also the aesthetic value , the quality of life and the reduced cost of living are by no means negligible .
In the early days of your presidency you have indeed been faced with substantial challenges .
I , and other members of my group , therefore reserve the right to vote against this report tomorrow - if this means voting on absurd matters - even though I warmly welcome the essence of the report .
We also need to think about the therapeutic technologies that we wish to give priority to .
All the parties are in favour of identical rights and obligations applying in all the Member States , and that is only possible if there is a single statute .
This one-sided nature of the charter either forced or allowed the candidates to present a united front on the issue of price stability and essentially , like other Pontius Pilates , to wash their hands of the matter of employment .
The budget amendments are important and essential for the proper management of the life and activity of Parliament .
We therefore need strong policies and especially a stronger reliable energy policy .
I think anyone who believes that the social partners should decide for themselves whom they wish to appoint will vote in favour of it , and anyone who has a sort of paternalistic view of the social partners will of course vote against ; they will do so in the context of the politically correct thinking observed on the other side of the House , and they will in fact be saying &apos; we are going to decide exactly whom the social partners can appoint &apos; .
I hope the Commissioner will do some work on this .
We can congratulate the rapporteur and the political groups .
The European Parliament has adopted today , Wednesday 20 October , the report by its Special Committee on the Financial , Economic and Social Crisis .
This is not about Hungary , either ; it is about freedom of the press .
The ethnic battles that have steeped this region in blood have thrown a human tide of 250 , 000 refugees onto the roads .
For this reason a strategic approach to the fight against terrorism is necessary and , indeed , crucial to guarantee the survival of Europe , its peoples and its cultures .
On behalf of the Commission , I would be more than happy to make myself available to Mr Karas in case he would like further information on this genuinely important point .
So , let us have some balance in this debate .
The directive shows our desire to harmonise the regulations currently in force in the different legal systems in a much more incisive way , avoiding the legal fragmentation that unfortunately has very often ended up being a hindrance both to undertakings - whose aim is to be able to be competitive on the cross-border market - and to consumers .
Thank you very much , Madam President , and I am also very grateful for this clarification , as it is vitally important that we are now going to talk about the microfinance facility .
The open statement that Schengen has often been violated and that this must not happen again ; the threat to the freedom of the individual from secret , illegally compiled blacklists ; the need to penalise , not least through international instruments , the disproportionate use of force by police forces ; the ban on discrimination between European citizens : all this , which is contained in the Watson report , is the plan of work for this Parliament , which , unlike the other parliaments in the Member States , manages to find a spirit of true unity on these matters .
When the issues are viewed from this perspective , the directive of the European Parliament and the Council concerning unfair business to consumer practices in the internal market clearly manages to achieve , as stated in the report , &quot; sufficient harmonisation of mutual recognition of national legislation &quot; , resulting in a proposal for a directive that the report rightly deems &quot; properly balanced &quot; .
We can certainly not stand by , we can certainly not wait , and certainly , too , with the strong action by Parliament pushing the Council and the Commission to act , we must guarantee safety for sea workers , and we must guarantee safety for goods coming from outside the European Union to supply the European Union .
The provisions of the report will relieve over 200.000 small and medium-sized enterprises of the task of filling out forms relating to the trading of goods , thus saving time and benefiting business and enterprise in general .
Unfortunately , I fear that my own party , the radical party , will again this year be one of the only parties , along with Wei Jinsheng and a few others , to speak up for the issue of human rights in China and Tibet ; who will bring the issue of Chechnya to the fore , while the Council , and the European Union which it represents , will again be absent from the United Nations .
For me this does not only concern BSE as a disease , but also other diseases and other parts of our agricultural policy which actually endanger people &apos;s health .
To this end , I would like to remind you of the resolution of 15 September , which recommended that the proposal be presented as soon as possible .
Having weighed up the issues , I abstained from voting .
It is about the level playing field .
It has allowed a broad convergence on key themes such as human rights , freedom of access to and communication of information , media or gender issues .
Following Chile &apos;s dark history , all our vigilance should be focused on political rights , in particular the fate of the Mapuche Indians .
That is why - and I agree with Mr Pinior here - we must use all the commercial policy instruments at our disposal to work for democracy and the rule of law .
The list of demands should be given serious consideration .
I do not know if our initiative relating to the Danube Region , the subject of our current negotiations , will be successful or not .
Of course society should have powerful tools to bring about freedom , security and justice , as the report states .
In my view Taiwan is a sovereign state .
Though I consider that the report is a good one , I think it is a shame that we have expunged certain parts through compromise , thus weakening it .
My report is based on one of three Commission proposals referred to the committee , which were drawn up with a view to fulfilling the obligations imposed by Article 7a of the EC Treaty .
Before the end of this decade , instead of being a major beneficiary of EU funding , we will become a net contributor to the EU budget .
There are many socio-political and ethical reasons for supporting basic research at university research institutes , which is unconstrained by the interests of big business and the war industry .
The Commission &apos;s directive as proposed wishes to make the rules on registering ship passengers in Member States more uniform .
In general , it is a question of an approach , or rather , a commendable intention consistent with the Montreal Protocol which , however , at the same time , does not take some facts into account : firstly , the fact that the other countries that are signatories of the Protocol , including the United States , anticipate longer time periods for ending the production of hydrochlorofluorocarbons ; secondly , hydrochlorofluorocarbons are , given the current state of knowledge , the only real alternative in the field of fire-fighting , to halogens , the main destroyers of the ozone layer , which are still widely used in developing countries .
If so , she should share the evidence with us , because there is no point in tabling an amendment like this without giving us that information .
This is a humanitarian issue , so it concerns you too .
In this future legislation it is crucial that targets are defined , as well as timetables and means to ensure compliance with the objective of achieving a 50 % reduction in the use of pesticides in the EU by 2010 .
I should also like to make a sincere , fraternal call to the Israeli and Egyptian authorities to make as much effort as possible to work together with international forces and with the new Palestinian Government appointed by President Abbas to rescue the Palestinians escaping persecution in Gaza , which has already cost the lives of many Gaza inhabitants .
In view of the fact , therefore , that Community provisions on taxation measures already exist , the Commission has seen no need to restate them in this present proposal .
That is why it is important that the Commission sets the direction here .
The Commission can accept four of the other five amendments , in other words Amendments Nos 1 , 2 , 5 and 6 , since they are aimed at consolidating the legal basis of the proposal .
However , as regards external action , in other words sanctions against third countries adopted by the UN , the European Parliament will have no power of codecision .
However , what we need to ensure and will ensure , and we have already taken the necessary measures , is that this crisis does not happen again in the future .
The problem is precisely as described by Mr Schulz , who was , for once , speaking with great clarity .
The House is also calling for the European Union to play a greater role in international cooperation and , via the Commission and the European Central Bank , to become a full member of the international institutions concerned .
Obviously , the Commission &apos;s position remains identical with regard to them .
There will be pain , but we will be able to manage that pain .
The next important step in this cooperative approach in EU tourism issues will be the first European Tourism Forum that the Commission is organising with the industry and other stakeholders on 10 December this year , to which all the European private and public stakeholders , including representatives of the European Parliament , will be invited .
Lastly , we should repeat that , as well as the operative measures to improve the management of programmes , with which - as I have said - the Committee on Development and Cooperation is in agreement in principle , we believe that the Commission should take the responsibility for reflecting and making proposals , which is an essential requirement if the Union wants to direct aid not only towards promoting the economic growth of the beneficiary countries but also so that that growth will reach all sections of the population , thereby fulfilling its commitment to the development of peoples and , therefore , its commitment to peace , since , without development , peace will always be difficult to attain .
On two details I will be voting against the amendment from our ultra-nationalistic and Catholic fundamentalists from Poland urging opposition to forced or &apos; coercive &apos; abortions .
As a member of the Committee on Budgets , I warn you against doing this with European funds from the European budget .
These objectives , as several have already made clear , and as others may well point out in the future , have not yet been achieved .
We wish today to have access to the text and the summary of the negotiations so that we may be fully involved in the legislative process .
We have nevertheless achieved a compromise , through discussion , and one with which we can live , since this directive will finally open up the market in services , albeit only partially .
The report endorses and further develops the finest legal principles we know .
Follow-up measures must chiefly originate on their side .
We have to thank Ukrainian President Yushchenko who , when he came to power , really started this initiative and has taken it up together with President Voronin .
We do , and it is the Stability and Growth Pact .
The European Parliament has adopted quite a number of resolutions on this conflict but , now , action is required .
We are counting on a substantial and strategic summit , because it will be focused on vital issues of international relations .
It would be odd , as pointed out here , if the European Union were to have strategic relationships , strategic partnerships with Russia , India and China , but not with Brazil .
In these circumstances it is essential for the Union to develop a coherent , over-arching strategy which will better define its strategic priorities in the 21st century for the world outside , and that must begin with this budget .
We must seize this opportunity and we must give ourselves the means to take full advantage of this possibility .
Consumers still have every reason to be distrustful , if they know the conditions under which some farms rearing livestock for meat are run , the food products and drugs used and the possible consequences on health .
Direct financial assistance to the Palestinian Authority is already being prepared in the form of a scheme to reimburse private sector arrears , as Salam Fayyad has asked us to do .
Despite the considerable number of new provisions , many application-related aspects have yet to be settled in order to make it feasible for REACH to be properly implemented in certain sectors , such as cosmetics , for instance .
In particular , Mrs Wemheuer &apos;s work in this matter has been exemplary .
The new Treaty confirms that , in principle , the areas in which codecision is not the general rule are exceptions to the system .
This must take into account the right of political asylum as laid down in the 1948 Geneva Convention , but also the commitments made within the European Union and the Schengen zone .
Organic substances have tremendous potential for the future development of rural areas as a whole .
Within the EU , we are agreed that our actions will be in keeping with the principles of the UN Charter . This means that a UN mandate is required for peace-enforcement operations . &apos;
I believe that Europe &apos;s most noble task is to advocate freedom and human rights .
In this agreement , which should be adopted by the end of 2007 , we call on the Council and the Commission to be more accommodating on the timing .
Our Member States , including France , have a long tradition of harbouring political refugees , and they intend to keep it .
It is very considerate of you to refer to Article 308 .
At the economic level , ensuring appropriate and transparent funding of the strategy and fighting corruption at all levels are the additional guarantees for the success of our joint activities .
Since July , following an urgent question of mine , Mr Fischler should to have informed me of the number and efficiency of plans for fire-prevention in Greece .
There was a lady there from Denmark who very nearly might not have been .
Total respect for national rights , the tolerance of peaceful assembly and the implementation of educational agreements are the only way towards achieving constructive dialogue and breaking the vicious cycle of terrorist activities and brutal repression .
I do agree that the section on officials has , in fact , been completed totally inadequately .
Therefore , we absolutely cannot guarantee what you are saying , Mr Barrot , namely , that this is a joint operation for people who , following individual assessments , have been found to be irregular migrants .
Moreover , the e-mail system is also being weighed down by this deluge of advertising and is thus becoming unusable for reliable communications .
We need to neutralise the murderous ideologies that create terrorists .
Finally , a Fortress Europe must be avoided , that is , border contacts with Russia and Ukraine should not be made more difficult for countries which are close to these two countries .
I am glad you raised the matter because it has allowed me to clear it up .
Instead , it will mean analysing and peer-reviewing the broad budgetary guidelines and fiscal balance before the submission of the draft national budgets by governments to Parliament with the legal right , based on the treaty and pact , for the EU to make recommendations and ask for corrective action from the Member States concerned .
But while we hear the message , what we lack is the belief .
The vote in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy frequently resulted in amendments being rejected or adopted by a very low margin .
I would like to see a picture of Neda Agha-Soltan next to the picture of Aung San Suu Kyi displayed on one side of the European Parliament building in Brussels .
With regard to Parliament &apos;s and other institutions &apos; budget , my group has adopted the approach of our rapporteur , Mr Grech , whom I should also like to thank for a constructive and substantial piece of work .
That applies to noise levels as well as to hazardous substances .
Thus , the general contents of the directives must be included in national or regional legislation as well , and an amendment has been tabled proposing this .
I have in the past written to you , Mr President , and I have received a reply from the College of Quaestors to say that demonstations of that nature at the door of this Chamber will not be allowed .
As to gentle and homeopathic medicines , these attract me but also leave me sceptical .
Even a small reduction spurs all manner of forces into action , standing up to demand that their region remain eligible .
As I have already mentioned several times , I question , together with a number of my fellow Members , the point of wasting immense energy and time on many occasions each year analysing and adopting a document which , in any event , only covers the reality in part .
This would have a highly counterproductive impact on the future of the EU and would make it difficult to agree on a common European approach or attitude to important issues , as the crisis in Libya has demonstrated .
Now , the plan is to introduce mechanisms at an EU level to settle disputes and to support politically unstable regions , such as Morocco , in establishing a homogeneous state characterised by peace , development , justice , equality , freedom , plurality , democracy and respect .
I believe there are two aspects that should be considered in relation to the second value , namely solidarity .
The result of all this is a proposal to amend at least 14 directives , a number of which have certain problems in common , and it is thus possible to identify them and examine them much more systematically .
I would , therefore , like to express support for this report , along with all the efforts to adopt means for putting budgetary affairs in order in accordance with the new treaty .
Thirdly , as regards defending and selling , there is a lot of talk about protectionism nowadays in the European Union .
They were also both created gradually in order to influence global economic and political development .
What I would like to ask Mr Kukan is that when Mr Markert was here from the Venice Commission and the two-thirds majority was mentioned - which keeps coming up here as well - he confirmed that the two-thirds majority does exist .
It is inevitable that unused buildings will become sick buildings if they are not regularly checked .
If it is not effective , we will abolish it ; if it is only partially effective and appropriate , it will have to be modified accordingly .
We are discussing the rights of mothers and of fathers , but we also need to discuss the right - the unconditional right - of a child to build a close relationship with both parents .
by Mr Haglund , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on enforcement measures to correct excessive macroeconomic imbalances in the euro area - C7-0299 / 2010 - .
( ES ) Mr President , I believe that it is important that we remove the ideological baggage from this debate on transatlantic relations .
However , it is also essential not to discourage potential beneficiaries of the Structural Funds with overly harsh restrictions .
In fact , the preliminary draft budget already provides for a reserve .
Mr President , Commissioner , that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development should entrust the drafting of its opinion to a man , and that the women on it should agree to that , is a demonstration of the importance we attach to this problem of equal treatment and equality of opportunity , as we take the view that these are issues not only - and here , &apos; not only &apos; is not meant to be restrictive - affecting women &apos;s social , environmental and cultural achievements , for there is no doubt that they do , but also the economic development of rural areas .
According to this debate , Europe , first and foremost , is that political Europe towards which we are striving , but it is also the result of economic and social cohesion .
Madam President , I am very much obliged to Mr Spencer for giving me the floor .
Following over half a century of European integration and numerous Treaties , the European Constitution is the one that brings by far the most visible and most practical benefits to the citizens of Europe .
I stand to support colleagues on this important regulation , which is on its second trip through the committees and these houses , because of a Court of Justice ruling 12 months ago that it should have been a dual legal base originally .
As the Vice-President of this House responsible for transparency , I have not always found it an easy subject , but I do believe that now we have the chance to do better and to reach out even further to our citizens .
I deeply regret that , rather than seizing this opportunity and building on it , our negotiating partners decided to take the easy way out , rejecting our offer on agriculture and criticising it - often in immoderate terms - rather than engaging with it and enabling us to move forward .
Mr Lechner should be aware that the judgement is interim and that we will not have a final judgement until the autumn .
This was encouraging and came just at the right time .
Mr President , we are unable to support the submitted resolution .
When the IGC has been successfully concluded in Amsterdam , we shall have to make a start on enlargement .
Only in this way can routine long-term measures also be maintained .
A new free trade agreement would be the best way of taking the world out of financial crisis and preventing protectionism .
To learn what flowers or fruit smell like it is better to buy the natural article .
These are decisive , especially when they have to pay back loans at a time of economic stagnation .
During the past few months Commission services have begun drafting EC legislation on a number of non-military items such as instruments of torture , to which the provisions of the code should , in our view , apply .
It was precisely during my period of responsibility that Latvia joined the US coalition in the Iraq war .
The golden share gives rise to a remarkable conflict of interests between the State which remains the manager and , to some extent , the owner of the liberalised companies , and the State which should have the sole role of regulator guaranteeing the competition which protects the interests of the citizens .
As in previous cases , the Court of Auditors has stated that its actions are legal and regular .
There can certainly be no turning back from that position , despite the fact that the world &apos;s more conservative countries have been attempting to do so for some years now . This was the case , in particular , with the United States last week during the proceedings of the UN Commission on women &apos;s rights .
Free movement should be developed by means other than the Schengen Agreement within the European Union , and such issues as those concerning data protection and the position of the individual are absolutely vital .
We need to redouble our efforts and to stand up for the people living in the Romany camps in conditions that are absolutely inhumane and unacceptable ; we need to forget the mother whose baby was almost abducted and the family of Mrs Reggiani , raped and killed just under a year ago , sadly a case that has occupied this Parliament .
This would not only apply to these alleged criminals but also to those who failed to report these so-called crimes , or who support human rights and other work in Uganda .
This means that the picture is much more encouraging than is usually thought .
This resolution should be seen by Tehran as a sincere , clear call for the continuation of negotiations and ought also to act as a useful step towards the involvement of the other major protagonist in this delicate issue , the United States of America .
Serbia is showing serious lapses in the field of respect for human rights .
Despite the well-known improvements achieved by the Treaty of Amsterdam in the promotion of equality between women and men in Community assignments , and with the recognition of the importance of mainstreaming and active equal opportunities policies in all Community actions , through the amendment of article 3 , I find it regrettable that article 118 places the European Parliament in a weaker position - as regards the fields of social security and the social protection of workers - than that of article 119 and that it makes it difficult to take decisions in favour of women because it demands unanimity on the Council .
All three models that the Commission has proposed for the common agricultural policy must remain open to discussion .
Fourthly , Mr President-in-Office , effective coordination and cooperation between the various services and the Member States is the real basis on which the protection of public health and the protection of consumers must be supported , as also the mapping out and execution of the necessary Community programmes and strategies in this area .
Furthermore , on another level definitely worth mentioning , the issue of desertification is also relevant within the European Union itself .
I liked the metaphor that was presented here that instead of having somebody who would stop the traffic , or mean red traffic lights , you would have a smooth operator , somebody that would actually help the traffic flow or decisions to be made in a democratic and good way in the European Union .
That is the signal we are waiting for and let us hope these expectations will not be disappointed .
Mr President , I voted in favour of the Barcelona Process and I would like to see it accelerated by this document .
A &apos; House of European History &apos; such as this should be established in the seat of the European institutions and should network with comparable foundations in the Member States .
Our constituents time and time again ask for reform of the CAP .
So it is no surprise that support for the Uribe administration is now greater than when he was elected , with a programme whose main objectives are to combat terrorism and bring peace to the country .
For our part , we wish to state in this House that we shall continue to take action every time a challenge is mounted , within a Member State or outside the Union , to the values of European humanism - the values on which our efforts at European integration are based .
Finally , European quality and security standards should also be adopted .
the need to link the various complementary competences present in the different countries of the Union and to carry out comparative studies on a European scale ;
The UN has adopted a number of standards for living conditions for the disabled in a number of social fields .
It also means that there is a strong chance of being conscripted into the army .
Only Saddam Hussein can be blamed for the deplorable living conditions they experience and we must not consider them to be a direct repercussion of the international embargo .
- I would like to give special thanks to the President-in-Office of the Council , Mr Alexander , and start by wishing him every strength and every success in his job and that of the British Presidency .
Apart from your natural elegance and the good manners that you have shown to the European Parliament I should like to tell you , Commissioner , that you were right to do this .
Of course , it is a good thing to go there , and I , too , thank Mr Solana and I thank Mr Moratinos very much , although I have to say that , at the time of the Quartet , Marc Otte was , in fact , absent because of Ariel Sharon &apos;s blackmail at the most sensitive moment when they were resuming talks on the Roadmap .
Therefore , the European Commission must take action in support of the application of such standards in developing countries , promote their quality and European nature and in this way develop an image of the European financial market and offer various solutions ( not only in a technical sense ) .
For us , as members of the European Union , the basic principles must be non-use of force , respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states and compliance in good faith with international agreements .
However , it is all too easy to imagine how well all this will work in practice , given the administrative capacity of the Russian authorities .
One cannot help but feel deep disgust , however , when politicians from the major powers , in particular France and the USA , who are overwhelmingly implicated in Haiti &apos;s fate , begin to lecture and moralise .
All of us know that this is not the only time that information on classified material has been passed on .
I refer to paragraph 3 in the Christmas list in the name of Mrs Frassoni and Mr Cohn-Bendit and the reference to the subsidiarity protocol , which is the biggest opportunity your Commission has to put meaning to the often empty phrases about subsidiarity and bringing Europe closer to the people .
The authorities are forcing through further restrictions on basic freedoms .
I would hope that the Commission will look again at what it is proposing and come forward with a maximum journey time , rather than this situation where animals can continue to travel long distances with periods of rest .
The role of patients as clients of health care services is of great significance to Parliament , as patients have the right to decide freely on their health and the care they receive .
Moreover , it is normal that , for operational reasons , certain languages are used more than others by Commission staff in their daily business .
I would like to underline once more that there is no direct link between the quantities of pesticides used and the risks they can pose to health and environment .
Of course , this remedy would only make things worse by reinforcing the supra-national aspect .
As the rapporteur makes clear , it was not so much a question of a lack of standards or legislative provisions , as of a refusal to abide by the rules of fair and open cooperation which must govern relations between the Member States of the Union .
I know this so well because I was involved myself .
( RO ) I believe we should focus our attention on overweight children and that we should try to create new programs for fighting obesity in early life , when we acquire our feeding habits .
Since the first Daphne initiative in 1997 , Daphne has funded around 460 projects . This represents a very important European contribution .
That was the argument put forward by a large founding Member State on the question of whether a takeover of Danone was permissible , even though the company &apos;s turnover and profits are predominantly generated abroad .
Unlike Mrs Dybkjær , I do believe that the amendment concerning rigorous environmental impact assessments is very important .
Secondly , we are convinced that if the World Bank &apos;s objective is to reduce poverty and alleviate the exclusion of indigenous populations and poor people , we cannot continue to support a method of financing a project that is detrimental from this point of view .
So we do not need any protocols , but a new third generation agreement .
I have to say that the Commission proposal to bring in electronic tagging as proposed will destroy the industry .
Applying the private profit approach to the financial resources of national pension systems and , to some extent , the salaries and savings of employees , which is what the financial participation of employees entails , means increasing the risk of financial crises and the socio-economic consequences of these , as the rapporteur in fact states : it means putting employees at a dual risk because in the event of the company &apos;s bankruptcy they will lose both their job and the value of their shares .
The way forward still lies largely in our own backyard .
on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - ( PL ) Mr President , the latest EU-Russia Summit did not bring any specific results .
Where are we going to find coal for steelworks all over the world if the emerging countries develop in line with existing technologies ?
However , it is not enough to take pleasure in its emergence . Our policies and decisions should reflect its demands and its aspirations in practical ways .
Until it has been proved that all phthalates are harmless , there is no place for plasticisers in toys for children under three .
Commissioner , on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation I would firstly like to thank the Commission for their communication on the promotion of human rights and also congratulate the rapporteur , Mrs Díez González , on her excellent report , which complements and strengthens the already positive proposals put forward by the Commission in their communication .
The operator has also informed the Commission of a number of operating problems due to customs procedures in Poland and difficulties with the Polish railways as well as with rail companies in the European Union .
I shall myself be making concrete proposals in the context of the budget to integrate environmental objectives into the common agricultural policy .
Why do we encourage that minority of Swiss legislators who see EU membership precisely as a way of sidestepping their voters and escaping their system of direct democracy ?
To my mind , an EU framework would be better .
Against this background , the Danish initiative is very noteworthy and significant from the Commission &apos; s point of view .
With all due respect for EU principles and legislation , we must promote and not hamper creativeness and flexibility at local , regional and national level .
Even if we vote for the report we wish to make known our strong reservations as listed above .
The Council sometimes laments Parliament &apos;s objections to security measures that it wants to introduce .
The difference in employment rates between the sexes is an average of around 20 % in the Member States .
When did they appeal to it ?
I believe that we must be aware of the fact that it is indeed possible that , in the coming weeks and years , this region will not experience political regimes that are both stable and inspired by freedom and moderation .
Unfortunately , this Chair is bound by the Rules of Procedure , and Rule 47 which applies to this urgent debate does not permit suggestions such as that made by Mrs d &apos;Ancona .
When I made enquiries , I was told that it was too late , that the subject was too technical and that there was no opinion to be given on this .
I know you will deny this , but I would like to hear you repeat it emphatically .
I would like to point out to you that this would also be a way of combating organized crime and drug-trafficking in Europe .
You helped them happen - you , and the others - with this dictatorship of free and fair competition , which is crippling our societies and destroying their public spirit and our public services .
- ( SV ) I voted in favour of the report .
We therefore explicitly look at many other indicators and analyses in the context of our two-pillar strategy , and we do not try to hide the complexity of monetary policy-making behind the production of a single Governing Council forecast .
Next week , moreover , a new veterinary inspection team will be going to the United Kingdom , and I have asked it to pay particular attention to ensuring strict compliance with Community legislation and the strengthening of physical controls in ports .
Besides , to deny this chance would mean increasing the isolation of that Mediterranean State from a Europe which has to seek dialogue , especially with those , as in this case , young people , who cannot be expected to take the blame for something that is not their fault , but which is the fault of a government which we still have our reservations about .
Mr. President , over the previous decade the European Coal and Steel Community has borrowed money from the markets and in turn has loaned funds for research activity in the coal and steel sector .
Only such an agreement will allow the economies of scale which arise from group purchasing .
This is very unfortunate because there are many honest , decent and appropriate operators , for example those represented by the Organisation for Timeshare in Europe , from which I have received important help in relation to my constituents .
We have to understand that , when faced with a crisis situation like the one we are currently going through , investing and devoting effort , time , political will and money to equality is something that demands not only all our ingenuity , but also , clearly , all our political will and our closest attention .
The thorough grooming proposed today allows European farmers to keep the positive aspects of multifunctionality by strengthening rural development , the system of modulation allowing them to pass from the first to the second pillar .
We must change our perspective completely and progress from the protection of individuals to the protection of peoples , for it is not fair for the inhabitants of East Timor alone to be able to exercise this right : all peoples must have the facility to exercise this right if they so desire , from the Sahara to Chechnya , from Taiwan to Kurdistan , and , of course , in Tibet .
The solution that has been reached for living donors is very important , as we cannot forget that living donations are complementary and have been shown to be effective even if there is no genetic relationship between the donor and the recipient .
. We abstained from the final vote on the resolution on the financial perspective for 2007-2013 , because we do not accept Recital No 4 of the resolution .
Mr President , it is well known that the textiles and clothing industry still has a considerable presence in the enlarged EU , employing around 2.7 million people , mainly women , even after shedding some 850 000 jobs and losing many thousands of businesses between 1990 and 2001 .
As other speakers have said , this is probably the most historic moment in Europe in the last 40 years .
Mrs Rothe and Mrs Graenitz are quite right to point out that many other policies are taken up by renewable energy , and there is a whole list : environment , agriculture , regional , transport , etcetera .
Do we not come closer to the truth when we follow this report further and it states that above all , the Amsterdam Treaty represents a strikingly clear failure compared with the original mandate of the Intergovernmental Conference and the three axes around which it was constructed , namely greater popular responsiveness on the part of the European Union , the reform of the institutions in a more democratic and efficient Union and the bolstering of the Union &apos;s capacity to act externally .
The second aspect of my supplementary question refers to policy on the structural funds and I should like the President-in-Office of the Council to give a fuller explanation of what he said . Am I right in saying that he promised that the Council &apos;s position would be to stick to all agreements already included in the financial perspectives ?
Secondly , Hungary has a long-standing tradition of democracy .
Conversely , these differences could also lead to no taxation at all .
Poland , which is one of the countries outside the euro area , will soon adopt the common currency , and we would like , today , to be responsible for the future form of the Eurogroup .
As far as democratic legalisation of the procedure is concerned , our experience to date is that only in the field of employment is there a legal basis in the Treaty .
Mr Dillen , who has now left , has just said that oppression of women is typical of the Koran - which is complete nonsense , as the matter of &apos; comfort women &apos; shows that men do not need the Koran to repress and abuse women .
In my opinion , what is now happening in Belarus and the kind of actions that Mr Lukashenko has dared allow himself to take when it comes to the Polish minority in this country are signs that he also is looking more to Moscow than to the West .
However , my life-long study and practice of Buddhism and my responsibility and involvement in the non-violent freedom struggle of the Tibetan people have given me some experiences and thoughts that I would like to share with you .
Therefore , the common asylum policy is an unresolved issue that cannot be hidden away .
Europe ought to demonstrate its own efficiency . I hope it is successful .
First of all I would mention increased coordination between economic and monetary policy .
We also consider that there are many respects in which the report introduces major improvements to the original proposal , and we congratulate Mrs Fraga accordingly .
As a pilot project , this is a very difficult task , because the methods of providing security for older citizens are very different across the European Union .
. I am delighted with the rejection of this report , and with our contribution to that rejection .
We will shortly be presenting guidelines relating to the new European Social Agenda , to deal with the problems of social exclusion , which I mentioned earlier and which persist .
None of this , though , will do any good unless we apply our European research efforts to all these health questions .
They are spending their money as planned and are also achieving quite a lot with it .
In Finland and Sweden the forest is the normal natural environment .
Sweden spends EUR 200 per person as a proportion of GDP , compared to EUR 100 in Ireland , yet Sweden is the third most competitive economy in the world , compared to Ireland &apos;s position at 26th .
To say that asylum seekers are now waiting for the correlation tables to be implemented is probably the most inventive and imaginative lobbying for the correlation table resolution to happen , so I hope Council was listening .
Mr President , Mrs Sierra González has tackled a variety of complex issues in her report .
( FR ) Madam President , I would like to welcome Mrs Hedegaard to our Chamber .
Tell us how you intend to move forward .
Unfortunately , according to the strategy of car manufacturers , these devices are available in a rather small proportion and often in a package of very expensive options .
What is the European Union to do with this region ?
I am happy to be able to sign this agreement with you , Mr President , in the presence of my Vice-President , Mrs Wallström , who is responsible for relations with Parliament .
125 million children will not be going to school today , which means they have no future in this world . Our world is not millennium-proof .
This programme supported a wide range of housing-related projects which range from improving shanty towns in Greece to aiding the regeneration of run-down social housing areas in Edinburgh .
There are , in fact , countless new elements , such as the creation of three new objectives : reducing the number of Structural Funds , strengthening the partnership , allocating more financial resources to islands and regions with geographical handicaps and protecting &quot; phasing-out &quot; regions , which will soon no longer be eligible under the convergence objective .
In fact you do not have to imagine it , because other police forces in Europe have already done it .
Madam Commissioner , I am glad you are here today .
The situation in the Middle East remains a cause for concern , and is of direct relevance to us in Europe given the energy dependence of the EU on foreign powers , much as my own Scotland is in the happy situation of being a net exporter of energy .
The concern expressed about political instability in the south and southeast Mediterranean , about the material damage caused by war , is hypocritical .
The present situation is that the decision is always taken on the basis of the financial situation , and this generally works out better for men .
It is difficult to discuss these matters without also seeing them in the light of what actually happened in Berlin .
If we want to grant agricultural subsidies and keep prices down at all , we should do this for healthy products .
Mr President , President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , like many of the Members here , I am delighted to note that the Brussels European Council was able to show that agricultural issues would not be a barrier to the entry of the ten countries to the European Union in 2004 .
Permit me to tell you , however , that your answer was very general .
However , even though some progress has been made with regard to stopping and prosecuting traffickers , it is still absolutely vital to give the victims better protection .
This requirement is essential .
Yes , it is sometimes frustrating to have to wait for a considerable period of time before there is action .
Everyone here is a member of the European Union .
Your opinion is indeed especially important for us , not only because , in principle , it adopts the approach of the European Commission , but mainly because it sets out new ideas and new issues for the development of the sector .
I am convinced that this information service can work properly only if there is close cooperation between the three institutions in question .
Intensive farming has a lot to answer for but it is simplistic to see this as the cause of the current outbreak .
Madam President , I agree with those speakers who said we have a real opportunity in front of us with a new US Administration in place .
The resulting antagonisms concerning &apos; the right policy &apos; are increasing , something we have noticed in this Parliament too .
There are three points as far as I can see .
Rather than expending efforts on that cause , the EU &apos;s interests and objectives are better served by building greater multilateral cooperation and making better use of the existing legal instruments .
In this connection , I hope that the government of my country , the Italian government , will manage to take effective action to prepare adequately for the eve , naturally cooperating with the other Member States of the Union .
The Energy Council will be meeting the day after tomorrow in order to discuss the Energy Action Plan , which is one of the really big issues for the European Council ; the Education and Youth Council meets on 16 February , followed by the Competitiveness Council on 19 February and the Environmental Council on 20 February .
Mr President , Environment Commissioner , I am pleased that you are here because we can now address this matter straight away .

Some say it is being interpreted too strictly and that governments are not spending enough . Others say the opposite , that we must stick to the Pact more tightly .
I will not accept the accusation that we , in Austria , take less account of minority rights than do other regions of Europe , but I do want consensus among the political forces , and I want to seek it with the people .
I felt unable to support this report in the final vote . The directive cuts fundamentally into national systems for informing workers ; yet we have not had sufficient evidence of the need for a supranational regulatory approach .
We are going though a difficult stage in Europe , in which we see a striking correlation between the extent of the problems and the governance capacity .
Work is to continue with regard to these important questions at the Eighth Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Basel Convention in Nairobi at the end of November .
This is a first step , but I would say that it is not the end of the beginning !
But there is , of course , nothing that cannot be improved further .
The way in which the reform project has ground to a halt at Commission level shows that the large majority of Member States and many of your own colleagues considered these proposals to be unacceptable and that they were actually geared towards a small but very vocal lobby .
Unfortunately , the report does not do this .
We need solid evidence .
